<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
