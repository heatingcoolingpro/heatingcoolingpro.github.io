<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
