<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
