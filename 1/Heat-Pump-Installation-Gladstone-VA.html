<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes since many of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and household products, are similar. Indoor air problems comparable to those in offices are brought on by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, poorly put outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and handy, Ballard Gas gave us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small however considerable modifications in his bid. Since of recent warmer summers and for environmental reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

Prior to we design and set up any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements generally include adding insulation and air sealing measures.
