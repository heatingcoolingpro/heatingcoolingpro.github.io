<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Max ND</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
