<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
