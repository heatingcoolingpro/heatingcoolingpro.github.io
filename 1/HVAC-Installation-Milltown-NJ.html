<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
