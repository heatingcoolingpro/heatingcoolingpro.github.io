<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Just like the majority of home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ widely based upon the size of the house. A lot of heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and efficiency.
