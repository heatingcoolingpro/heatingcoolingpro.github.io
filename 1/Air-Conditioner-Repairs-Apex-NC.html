Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in covert or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
