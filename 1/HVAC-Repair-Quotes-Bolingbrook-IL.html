<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
