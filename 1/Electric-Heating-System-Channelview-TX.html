The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
