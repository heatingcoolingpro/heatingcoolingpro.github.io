<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
