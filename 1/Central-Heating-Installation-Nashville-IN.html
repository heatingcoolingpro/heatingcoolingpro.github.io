<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>

In general a very first rate experience.<p>
