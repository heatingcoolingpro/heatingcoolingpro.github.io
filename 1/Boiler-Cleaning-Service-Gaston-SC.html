<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
