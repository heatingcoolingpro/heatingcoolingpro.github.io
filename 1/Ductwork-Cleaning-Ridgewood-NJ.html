<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
