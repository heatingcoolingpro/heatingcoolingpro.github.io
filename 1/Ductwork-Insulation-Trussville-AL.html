<p>The heatpump acquired appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
