<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a range of signs from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, nausea, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in people with persistent heart disease.
