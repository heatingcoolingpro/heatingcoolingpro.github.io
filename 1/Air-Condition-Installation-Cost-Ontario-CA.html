<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Systems in Ontario CA</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
