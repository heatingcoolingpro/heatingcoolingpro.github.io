<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation company entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
