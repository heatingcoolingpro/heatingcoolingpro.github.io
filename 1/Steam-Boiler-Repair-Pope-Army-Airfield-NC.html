<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
