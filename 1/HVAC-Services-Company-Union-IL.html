<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
