<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Tranquillity CA</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Tranquillity CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
