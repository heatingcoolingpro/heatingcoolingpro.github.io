If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers.

For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators.
