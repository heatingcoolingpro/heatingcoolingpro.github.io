<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>My oldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itÃ¢ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
