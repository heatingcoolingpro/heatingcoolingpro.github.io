<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's five years of ages or older.

<p>New ac system generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score indicates greater energy performance and potentially lower energy expenses. A good SEER rating for you depends on your house size, where you live and other elements.

Actions that will reduce benzene exposure include getting rid of cigarette smoking within the home, providing for maximum ventilation throughout painting, and disposing of paint products and unique fuels that will not be utilized right away.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts however the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're extremely allergic to dust.
