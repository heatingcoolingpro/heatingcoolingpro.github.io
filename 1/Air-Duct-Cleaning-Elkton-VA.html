<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
