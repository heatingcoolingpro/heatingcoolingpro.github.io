Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity.

A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
