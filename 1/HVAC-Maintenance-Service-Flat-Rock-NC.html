<p>We look at clues before we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can afford, a lot of Seattleites should discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
