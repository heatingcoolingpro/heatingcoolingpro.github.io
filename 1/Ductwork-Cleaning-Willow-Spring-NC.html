<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

If temperature levels reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>

Additionally, these cams are also high resolution to identify even the tiniest cracks that standard examination video cameras would miss out on. Lastly, with the use of a water test Out Today service technicians have the ability to evaluate the integrity of the heat exchanger.<p>
