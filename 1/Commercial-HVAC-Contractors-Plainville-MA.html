<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
