<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Cedar Falls IA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
