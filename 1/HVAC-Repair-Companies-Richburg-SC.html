<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your house, providing a comfy environment in every space. However ducts that are not installed effectively or preserved can disperse pollutants from one room to another.
