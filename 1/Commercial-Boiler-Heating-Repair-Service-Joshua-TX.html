<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
