<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
