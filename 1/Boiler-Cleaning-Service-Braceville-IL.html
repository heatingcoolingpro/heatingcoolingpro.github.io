<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
