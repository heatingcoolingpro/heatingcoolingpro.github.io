<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically challenging to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to pay attention to the time and place symptoms happen. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Considering that pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to minimize using chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside your home. Depending on the site and bug to be managed, several of the following steps can be reliable: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be minimized or avoided by making sure that wooden structure products do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood far from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be considerably decreased.<p>
