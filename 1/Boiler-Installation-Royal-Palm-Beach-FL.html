Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
