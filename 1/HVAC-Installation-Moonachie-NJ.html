<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
