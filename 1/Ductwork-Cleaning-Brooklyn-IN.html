<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room a/c offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
