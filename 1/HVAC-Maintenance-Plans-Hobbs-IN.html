<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Lots of common structure products utilized before 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimal due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is often advised instead.<p>
