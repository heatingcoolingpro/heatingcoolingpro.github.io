<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
