<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an appropriate range that could prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
