On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having solved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
