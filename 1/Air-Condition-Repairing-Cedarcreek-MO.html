HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
