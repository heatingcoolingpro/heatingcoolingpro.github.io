<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Alpena AR</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
