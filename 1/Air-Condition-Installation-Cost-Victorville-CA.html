<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning devices. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
