<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor.
