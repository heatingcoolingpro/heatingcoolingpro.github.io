<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is normally utilized in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
