<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
