<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat.

The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window.
