Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
