<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
