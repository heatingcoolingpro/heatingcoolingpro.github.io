<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heating system, you may search for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
