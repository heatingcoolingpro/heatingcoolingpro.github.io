From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
