Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
