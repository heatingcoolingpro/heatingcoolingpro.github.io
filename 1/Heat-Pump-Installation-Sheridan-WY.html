<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
