<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in integrating a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you pick for your home.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
