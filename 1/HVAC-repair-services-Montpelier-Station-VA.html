<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
