<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>

For example, humans exhale co2, which in little amounts is not toxic, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
