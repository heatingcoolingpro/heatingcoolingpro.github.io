<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>When the temperature levels keep climbing up, geothermal air conditioning is a economical and wise method to cool down your house or location of service. But when your AC system stops working efficiently or begins to malfunction, you need an educated contractor to come in and get it fixed as rapidly as possible. And that's where we can help. At Around the Clock Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. in Rye Brook, NY, we provide geothermal a/c repair services to commercial and residential customers alike.<p>

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
