<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. A basic air conditioner transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
