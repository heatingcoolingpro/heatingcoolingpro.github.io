<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
