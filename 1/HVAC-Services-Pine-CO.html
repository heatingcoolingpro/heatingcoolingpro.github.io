<h3>How To Choose An HVAC Company at Pine CO</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of signs from headaches, d izziness, weakness, queasiness, confusion, and disorientation, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are often puzzled with the influenza or food poisoning.
