To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limits use dose-response information which reveal the health results of repetitive direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar data is not offered for long-term, low-level exposures to a mix of pollutants as is the case for IAQ problems.
