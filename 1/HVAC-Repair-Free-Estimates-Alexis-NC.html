<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Alexis NC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
