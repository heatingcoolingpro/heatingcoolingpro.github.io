At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location.
