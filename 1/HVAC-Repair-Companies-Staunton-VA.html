It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of reducing direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will lower but not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to significantly lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. As a result, the most effective method to decrease exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate cigarette smoking there.<p>
