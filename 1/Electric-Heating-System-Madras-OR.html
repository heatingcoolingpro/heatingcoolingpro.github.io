<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are usually utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
