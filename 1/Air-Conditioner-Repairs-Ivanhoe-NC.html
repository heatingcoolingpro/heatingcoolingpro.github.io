<h3>Check Out Ductwork In Ivanhoe NC Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
