<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
