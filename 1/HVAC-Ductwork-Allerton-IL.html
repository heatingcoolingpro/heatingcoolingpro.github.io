<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
