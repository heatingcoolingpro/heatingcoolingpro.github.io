<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
