<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and harden-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
