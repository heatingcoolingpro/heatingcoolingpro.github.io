<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
