The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
