<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Kilgore TX</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
