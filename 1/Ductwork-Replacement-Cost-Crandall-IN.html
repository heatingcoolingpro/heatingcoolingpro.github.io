For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
