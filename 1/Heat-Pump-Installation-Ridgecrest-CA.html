<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other advantages.

Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
