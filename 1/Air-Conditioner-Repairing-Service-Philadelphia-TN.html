A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
