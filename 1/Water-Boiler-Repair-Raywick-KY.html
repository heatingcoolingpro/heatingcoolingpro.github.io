<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
