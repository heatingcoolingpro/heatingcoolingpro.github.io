<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
