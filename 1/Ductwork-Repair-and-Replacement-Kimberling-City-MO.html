<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
