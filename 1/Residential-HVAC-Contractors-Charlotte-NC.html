<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
