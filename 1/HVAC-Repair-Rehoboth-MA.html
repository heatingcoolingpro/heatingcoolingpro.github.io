<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
