<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Strausstown PA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I highly advise using this service. Really reliable incredibly nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty quickly and effective and did not need to pay an arm and a leg to get it done. Terrific company started by a guy who is wanting to grow his organisation and protect his household. He set up a total system inside and out. Great unit and an excellent rate. I am currently on the maintance strategy. He looks after it twice a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>
