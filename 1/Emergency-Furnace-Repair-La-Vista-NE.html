<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your La Vista NE Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
