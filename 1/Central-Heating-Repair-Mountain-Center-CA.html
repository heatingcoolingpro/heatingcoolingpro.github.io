<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>The ability of natural chemicals to trigger health results varies considerably, from those that are highly hazardous, to those with no known health effect. Just like other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health impact will depend upon many factors including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing system irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual conditions, and memory disability are amongst the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced right after exposure to some organics. At present, very little is learnt about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes. Many natural substances are known to trigger cancer in animals; some are suspected of triggering, or are understood to cause, cancer in human beings.<p>
