<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales male pertains to your house he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water locations).

The collector's glass can be washed periodically to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
