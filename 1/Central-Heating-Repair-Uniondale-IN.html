<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
