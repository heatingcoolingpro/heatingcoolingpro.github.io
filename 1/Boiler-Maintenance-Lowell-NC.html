<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Lowell NC</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
