<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A Trane a/c unit can range in rate from $4,000 - $10,000. Our prices guide discusses all the aspects that affect your rate.
