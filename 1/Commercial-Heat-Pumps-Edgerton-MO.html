<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance.
