<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
