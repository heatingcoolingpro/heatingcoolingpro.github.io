<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Ayer MA</h3>
<p>There are numerous reasons this can happen. The good news is that you can deal with a number of these factors on your own without the need to call for expert assistance. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that move on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover. You can likewise examine the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
