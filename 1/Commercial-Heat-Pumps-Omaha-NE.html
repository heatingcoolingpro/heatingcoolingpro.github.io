Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are often used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
