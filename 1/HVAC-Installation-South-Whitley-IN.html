<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
