These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

A home heated up by a glowing system will heat up quicker, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the many advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
