<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
