<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
