He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
