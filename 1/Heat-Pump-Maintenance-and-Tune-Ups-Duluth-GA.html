<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
