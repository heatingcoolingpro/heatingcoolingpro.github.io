<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
