Structures continuously evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the residents, materials, and activities within them.

Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors.

<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.
