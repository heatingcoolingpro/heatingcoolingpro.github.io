Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement might be the most economical service.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
