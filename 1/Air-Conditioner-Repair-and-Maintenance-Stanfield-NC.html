<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
