<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.
