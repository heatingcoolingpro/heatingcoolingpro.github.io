<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
