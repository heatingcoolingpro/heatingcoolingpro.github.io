<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
