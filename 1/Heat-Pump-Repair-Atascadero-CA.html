<p>Info offered in this safety guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be readily available for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years.

Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
