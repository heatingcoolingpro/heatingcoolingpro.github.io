<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can typically be carried out in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Portland IN</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
