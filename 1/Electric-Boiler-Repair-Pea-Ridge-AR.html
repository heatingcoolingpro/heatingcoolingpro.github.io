<p>These men have actually been terrific. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these men two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work till you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
