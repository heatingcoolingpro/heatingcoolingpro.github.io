<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, but care should be required to ensure convenience. In warm or humid environments, keeping thermal convenience solely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when suitable.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm.
