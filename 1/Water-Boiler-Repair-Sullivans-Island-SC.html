<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electricity, a heat pump is a cost-efficient solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
