<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
