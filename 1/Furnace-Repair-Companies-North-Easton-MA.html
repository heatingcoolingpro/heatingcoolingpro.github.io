<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system.
