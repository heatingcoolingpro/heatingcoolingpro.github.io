<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers during the slow season can help alleviate the peak season stress on your tech crew, as kept in mind in A/c, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Service technicians can mainly focus on responding to calls from new customers, while your developed clients remain happy as their HVAC systems hum along perfectly thanks to proactive examinations. The marketing part of your company plan for an HVAC company must include how you'll market these kinds of services.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can take to select items that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.

<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the general indoor air quality meets a particular requirement.
