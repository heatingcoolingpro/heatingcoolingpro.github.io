<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with issues. I would advise this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
