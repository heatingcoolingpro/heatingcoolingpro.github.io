<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
