<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
