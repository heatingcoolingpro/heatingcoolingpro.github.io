<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>5. Smell good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney fragrance with a tidy kitchen area or tidy synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners discharge lots of various chemicals into the air.
