<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized.

(He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
