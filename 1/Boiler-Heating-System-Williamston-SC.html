<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.
