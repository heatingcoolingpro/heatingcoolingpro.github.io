The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
