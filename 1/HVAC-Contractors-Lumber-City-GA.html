The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers.
