They can lead to a dangerous accumulation and jeopardize your safety if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 usually.

Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the whole home will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
