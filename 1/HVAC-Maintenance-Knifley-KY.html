Professionals are typically required to operate in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofings of houses. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for long periods of time. Given that they are called to structures without working climate control, they are likewise based on the extreme hot or cold temperature levels existing inside an area.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
