<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data may identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
