<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Floyds Knobs IN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
