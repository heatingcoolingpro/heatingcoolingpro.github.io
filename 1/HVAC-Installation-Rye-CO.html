Simply as with switches, someone might have turned off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends upon how old your furnace is. You may have a pilot light if you have an old furnace or boiler.

Central air conditioners should be professionally examined and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination.
