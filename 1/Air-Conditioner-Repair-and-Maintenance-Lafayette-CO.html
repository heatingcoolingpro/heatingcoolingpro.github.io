<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main hazard of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than many allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.<p>
<p>The answer to the question, What does an HVAC technician do?, will differ somewhat depending on industry of position, specialty, and employment. What does not differ is the value of the work that these professionals do.

<p>Numerous disconnect blocks contain two cartridge fuses. Examine them before you continue with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse suggests a stopping working part inside the condensing system.

If it blows once again, call a pro-- you've got more serious issues.<p>
