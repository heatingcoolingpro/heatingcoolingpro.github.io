Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c equipment.

Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
