<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day.

He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
