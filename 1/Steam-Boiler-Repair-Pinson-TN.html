<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Pinson TN Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Sean was really useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
