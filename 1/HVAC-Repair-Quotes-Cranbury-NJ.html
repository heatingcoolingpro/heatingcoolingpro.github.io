<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
