Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be successfully determined or corrected without a thorough building examination. These examinations may start with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure investigators examine the history of resident signs and structure operation treatments.
