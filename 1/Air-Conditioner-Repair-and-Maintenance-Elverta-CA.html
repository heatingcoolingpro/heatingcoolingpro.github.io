<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Elverta CA</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more extreme with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
