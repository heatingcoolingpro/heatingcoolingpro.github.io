<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied exceptional, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, efficient and appealing. He plainly and thoroughly explained all issues and repairs in a way that made me confident in his capability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my other half and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also reacted to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to a problem that could not be fixed on the first go to due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal performance and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your house. It will have to work harder and may get too hot if the system is too small. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
