<h3>AC Duct Repair in Waterloo IA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
