<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
