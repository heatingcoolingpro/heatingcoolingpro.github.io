<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time.

Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
