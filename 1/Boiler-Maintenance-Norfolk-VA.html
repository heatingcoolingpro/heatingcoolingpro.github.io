<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective.
