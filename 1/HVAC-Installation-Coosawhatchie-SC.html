<h3>AC Technician in Coosawhatchie SC</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, especially if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air.
