<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
