<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Sulphur Springs AR</h3>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
