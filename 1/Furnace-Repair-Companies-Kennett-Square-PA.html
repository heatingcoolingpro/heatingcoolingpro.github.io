<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that sometimes shows up. When you do see your furnace behaving oddly, it is very important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you react to problems with your furnace, the simpler they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will only make the problem worse, and frequently more costly.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a brand-new structure. Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is important iin guaranteeing the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Usually, a 3-ton setup should suffice for the typical home, however home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will influence the appropriate size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
