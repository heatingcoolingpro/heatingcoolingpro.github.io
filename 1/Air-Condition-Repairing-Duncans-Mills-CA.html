<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, intend on spending several thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system figures out the labor hours involved to build the system. When you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may notice musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not harmful, but might become dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire workplace or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
