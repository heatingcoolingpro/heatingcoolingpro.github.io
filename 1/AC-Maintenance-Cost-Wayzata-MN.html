<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as major issues, however much of the danger also comes from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
