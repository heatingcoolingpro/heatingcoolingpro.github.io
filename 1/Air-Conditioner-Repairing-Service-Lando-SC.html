Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.

The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
