Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon.
