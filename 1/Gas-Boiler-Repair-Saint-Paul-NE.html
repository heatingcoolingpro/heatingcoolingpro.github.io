<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
