<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually.

Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
