<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
