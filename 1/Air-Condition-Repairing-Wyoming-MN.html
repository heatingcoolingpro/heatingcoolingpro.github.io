<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be set up in a new building.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>
