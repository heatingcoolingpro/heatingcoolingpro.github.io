<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated.
