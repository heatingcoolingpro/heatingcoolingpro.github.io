<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
