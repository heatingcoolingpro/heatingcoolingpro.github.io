<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Turners Station KY</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC.
