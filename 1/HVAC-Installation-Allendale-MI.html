<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
