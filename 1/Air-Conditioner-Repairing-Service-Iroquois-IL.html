<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside.
