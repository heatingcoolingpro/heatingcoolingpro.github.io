<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs.

They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
