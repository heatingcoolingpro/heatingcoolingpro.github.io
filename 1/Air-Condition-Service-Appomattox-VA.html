<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same).

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
