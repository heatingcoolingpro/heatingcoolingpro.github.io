<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Clearwater FL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
