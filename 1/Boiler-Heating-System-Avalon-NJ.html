<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Avalon NJ</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri.
