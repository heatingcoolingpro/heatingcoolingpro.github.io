He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
