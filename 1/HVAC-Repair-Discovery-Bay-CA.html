<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
