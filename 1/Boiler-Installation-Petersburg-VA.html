<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
