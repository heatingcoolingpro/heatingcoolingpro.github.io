<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully.
