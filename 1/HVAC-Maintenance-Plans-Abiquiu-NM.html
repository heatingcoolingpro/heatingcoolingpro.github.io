He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
