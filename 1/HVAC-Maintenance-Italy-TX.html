(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
