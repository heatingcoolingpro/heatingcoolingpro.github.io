<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
