<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
