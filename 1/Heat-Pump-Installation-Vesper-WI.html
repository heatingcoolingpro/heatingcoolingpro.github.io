<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
