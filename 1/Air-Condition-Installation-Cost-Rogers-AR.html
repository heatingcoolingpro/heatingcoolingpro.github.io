<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.
