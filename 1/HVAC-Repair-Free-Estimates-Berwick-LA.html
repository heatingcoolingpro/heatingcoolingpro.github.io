<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
