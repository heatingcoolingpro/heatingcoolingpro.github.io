<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green building movement.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>

Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
