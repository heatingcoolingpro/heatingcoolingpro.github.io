<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for years, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations develop indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
