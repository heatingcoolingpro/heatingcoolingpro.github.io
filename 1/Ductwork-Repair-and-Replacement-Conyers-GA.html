<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Conyers GA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
