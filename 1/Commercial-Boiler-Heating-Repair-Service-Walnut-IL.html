These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, supplying a comfortable climate in every room. But ducts that are not set up effectively or preserved can disperse contaminants from one room to another. In time, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, minimizing the general air quality. Work with an expert to ensure your ducts are distributing fresh, clean air.<p>
