<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Arp</h2>

<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective.

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
