<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
