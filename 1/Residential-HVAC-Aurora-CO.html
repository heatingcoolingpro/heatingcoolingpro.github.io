<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Aurora CO</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain because they only partly remove the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a dependable means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of illness brought on by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
