<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
