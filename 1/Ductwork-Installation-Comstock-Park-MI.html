<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern.
