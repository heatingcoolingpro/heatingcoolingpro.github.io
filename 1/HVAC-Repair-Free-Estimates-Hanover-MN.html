<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
