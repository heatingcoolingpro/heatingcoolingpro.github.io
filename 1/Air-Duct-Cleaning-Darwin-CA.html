<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
