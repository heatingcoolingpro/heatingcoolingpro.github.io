<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants.
