This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil.

Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
