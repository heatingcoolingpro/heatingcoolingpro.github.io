<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than space air conditioners. In addition, they are out of the method, quiet, and convenient to run. To save energy and money, you need to shop an energy-efficient ac system and reduce your central air conditioning conditioner's energy use.
