Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.

This is usually used in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
