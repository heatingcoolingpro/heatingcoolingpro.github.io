<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment buildings and large houses. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a couple of years ago.<p>
