<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary considerably from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may require completely different steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Setups can likewise vary considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. Sometimes, completely brand-new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfy environment in every room. But ducts that are not set up appropriately or kept can distribute pollutants from one room to another.
