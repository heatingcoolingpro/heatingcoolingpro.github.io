<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
