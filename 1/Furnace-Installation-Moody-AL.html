<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Toxins could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below.
