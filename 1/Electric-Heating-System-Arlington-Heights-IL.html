<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
