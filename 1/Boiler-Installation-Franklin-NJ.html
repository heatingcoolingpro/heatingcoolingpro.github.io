<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
