<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and dependable  source of energy.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
