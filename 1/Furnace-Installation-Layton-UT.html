<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
