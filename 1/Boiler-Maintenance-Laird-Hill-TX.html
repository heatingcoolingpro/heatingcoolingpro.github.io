Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
