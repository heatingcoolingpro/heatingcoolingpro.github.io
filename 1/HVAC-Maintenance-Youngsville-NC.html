This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
