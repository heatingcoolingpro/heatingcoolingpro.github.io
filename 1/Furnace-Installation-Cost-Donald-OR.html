Extremely affordable, and energy-efficient, and providing greater control over when and where the air goes in your home, All Points Heating can help you pick the best ductless cooling system for your requirements.<p>
<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
