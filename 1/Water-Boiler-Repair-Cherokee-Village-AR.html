<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside.

According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint materials, and auto emissions in attached garages. Actions that will decrease benzene exposure consist of getting rid of smoking cigarettes within the home, attending to maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and unique fuels that will not be utilized instantly.<p>
<p>Outdoor impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Specialists suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
