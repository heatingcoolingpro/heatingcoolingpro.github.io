<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
