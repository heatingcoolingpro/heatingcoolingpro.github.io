<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
