<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Kempton IL</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
