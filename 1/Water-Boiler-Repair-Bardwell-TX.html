<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was initially driven by rising energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental problems. In addition, enhancements to the HVAC system efficiency can also assist increase resident health and productivity. 21 In the United States, the EPA has enforced tighter limitations over the years. There are a number of methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
