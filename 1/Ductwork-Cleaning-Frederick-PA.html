<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
