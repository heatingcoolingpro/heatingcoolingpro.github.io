To put it simply, in-floor heating unit supply a different mode and level of comfort.

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, expert and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge easily people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss information that produces a job effectively done. I really highly suggest the 2 gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better option. If the present system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
