<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service. If the present system has not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
