<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the unit is integrated.
