<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become blocked with debris that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

To handle condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
