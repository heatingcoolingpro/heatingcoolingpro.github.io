Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most fantastic was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right prior to a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
