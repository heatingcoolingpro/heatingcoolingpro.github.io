<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
