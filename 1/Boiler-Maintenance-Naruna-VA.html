<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
