A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be installed.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature remains constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer dependable and constant heating & cooling.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
