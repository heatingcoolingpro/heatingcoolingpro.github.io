<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's an easy issue like debris blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.

Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide consistent and reputable heating and cooling.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC specialists frequently discover themselves working in confined and uncomfortable areas, at extreme heights, and in some cases in unsafe conditions like severe weather condition (to service outside heat pumps and heat exchangers).
