<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
