<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
