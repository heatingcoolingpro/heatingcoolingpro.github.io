The style professional must seek advice from ASHRAE information for the requirements of design and care as the typical building regulations provide little to no info on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
