<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Adamsville AL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
