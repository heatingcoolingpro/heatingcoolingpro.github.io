<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
