<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
