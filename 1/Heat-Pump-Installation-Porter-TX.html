<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Porter TX</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon celebrations.<p>
