<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>

However more intricate concerns-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three tactics listed below may be proper.<p>
