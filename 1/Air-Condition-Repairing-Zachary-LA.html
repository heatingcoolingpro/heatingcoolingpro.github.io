<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
