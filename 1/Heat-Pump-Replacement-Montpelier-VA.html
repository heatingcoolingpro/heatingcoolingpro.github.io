<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously.

The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
