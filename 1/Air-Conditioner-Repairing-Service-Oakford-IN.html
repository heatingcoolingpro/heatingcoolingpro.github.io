<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, till the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.
