<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
