<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
