<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
