If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c devices.

<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
