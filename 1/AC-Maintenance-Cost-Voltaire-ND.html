<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are normally short-term and treatable.

Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
