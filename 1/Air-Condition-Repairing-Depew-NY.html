<p>You're motivating the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and straightforward method to reduce ambient air pollution and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
