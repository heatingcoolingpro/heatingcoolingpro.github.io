<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
