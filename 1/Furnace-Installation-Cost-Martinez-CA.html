<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Martinez CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

If the sensor is knocked out of position, the air conditioner could cycle constantly or act unpredictably. The sensing unit needs to be near the coil however not touching it; change its position by thoroughly flexing the wire that holds it in location.<p>
