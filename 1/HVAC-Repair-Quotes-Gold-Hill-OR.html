And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be used to help you spend for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace.

In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location.
