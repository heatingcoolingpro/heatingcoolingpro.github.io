<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
