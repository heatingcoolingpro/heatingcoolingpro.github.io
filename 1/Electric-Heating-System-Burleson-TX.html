<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
