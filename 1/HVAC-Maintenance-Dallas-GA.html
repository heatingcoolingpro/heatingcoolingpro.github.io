Not all heating systems benefit all homes, and there are a number of factors that definitely need to be thought about prior to picking one. First, you'll need one that is effectively sized for your house. A furnace that is too big will put out too much heat for your system to deal with, and will trigger problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not have the ability to supply enough heat to keep your house comfy.<p>
<p>When setting up radiant heating, you must give serious thought to the kind of flooring covering in the house. Because it conducts and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work fairly well. Carpeting will straight insulate the flooring from the space, decreasing efficiency, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>
