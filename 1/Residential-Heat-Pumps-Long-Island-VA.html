<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Long Island VA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
