Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.
