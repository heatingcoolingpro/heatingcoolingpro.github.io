<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a scientific way of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heat pump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for each unit of energy utilized to power the system, three to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was type of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Because they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
