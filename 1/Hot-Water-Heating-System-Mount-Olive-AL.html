<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house.

The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.
