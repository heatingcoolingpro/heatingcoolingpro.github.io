<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, considering that it is protected inside your home. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.
