<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time.

We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
