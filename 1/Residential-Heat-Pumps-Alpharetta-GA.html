<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
