<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
