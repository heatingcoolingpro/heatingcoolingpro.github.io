<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
