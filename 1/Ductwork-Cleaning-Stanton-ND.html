<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
