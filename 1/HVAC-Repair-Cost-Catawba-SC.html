<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
