<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
