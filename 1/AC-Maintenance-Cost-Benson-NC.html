<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs.

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation.
