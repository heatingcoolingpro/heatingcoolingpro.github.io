<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Sammamish WA</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
