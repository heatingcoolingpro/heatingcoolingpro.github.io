<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Rockford MN</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
