<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
