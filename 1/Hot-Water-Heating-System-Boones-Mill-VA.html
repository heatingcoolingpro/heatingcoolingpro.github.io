<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
