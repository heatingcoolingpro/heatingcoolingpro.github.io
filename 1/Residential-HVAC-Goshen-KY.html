All of the latest furnaces are far more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years back. So, while it may seem like a short-term larger expense, a new, more energy-efficient home heating unit will more than most likely save you cash in the longer-term by decreasing your annual energy expenses.<p>
<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work growth for HVAC professionals in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions.
