<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
