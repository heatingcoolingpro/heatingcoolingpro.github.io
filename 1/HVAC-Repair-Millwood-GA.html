<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
