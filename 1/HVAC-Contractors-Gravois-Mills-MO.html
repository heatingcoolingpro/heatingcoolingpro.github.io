<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
