<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
