<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
