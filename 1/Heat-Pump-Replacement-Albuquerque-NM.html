Structures constantly develop as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly connecting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing a little over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.
