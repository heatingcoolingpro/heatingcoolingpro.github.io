<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly.

While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
