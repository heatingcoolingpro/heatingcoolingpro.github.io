Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
