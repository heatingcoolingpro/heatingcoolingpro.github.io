<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
