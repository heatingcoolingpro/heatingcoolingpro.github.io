<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply consistent and reputable heating and cooling.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trusted than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>
