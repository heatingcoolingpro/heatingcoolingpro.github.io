<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed.

If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
