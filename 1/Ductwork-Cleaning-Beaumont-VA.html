<p>These men have been great. At a realtor, I often require contractors to provide me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these people twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
