<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
