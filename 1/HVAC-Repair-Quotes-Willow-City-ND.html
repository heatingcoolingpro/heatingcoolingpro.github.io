<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins released by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous individuals.<p>
