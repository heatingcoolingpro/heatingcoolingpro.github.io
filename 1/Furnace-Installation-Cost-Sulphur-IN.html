<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-410a and r-404a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
