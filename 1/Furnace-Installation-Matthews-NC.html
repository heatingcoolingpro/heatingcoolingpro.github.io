Numerous common structure materials utilized prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.
