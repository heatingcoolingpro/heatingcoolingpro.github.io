<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
