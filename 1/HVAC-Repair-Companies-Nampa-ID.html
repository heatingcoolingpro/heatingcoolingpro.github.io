<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
