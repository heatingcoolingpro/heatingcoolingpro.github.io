<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced.
