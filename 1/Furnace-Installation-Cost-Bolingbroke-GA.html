<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Bolingbroke GA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
