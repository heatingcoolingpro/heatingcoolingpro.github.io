<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Mount Washington KY</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part.

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Mount Washington KY</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
