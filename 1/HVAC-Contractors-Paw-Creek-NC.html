<p>If your furnace has simply died in sub-zero temperatures or your a/c has gone kaput on a blistering day, you'll probably be glad to hire the first repairman who comes to your house that day.

Perhaps Real estate agents need to consider a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system might contribute to, or deduct from, any given asking price. That stated, homebuyers looking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
