<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Itasca IL</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>A specialized ac system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
