<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
