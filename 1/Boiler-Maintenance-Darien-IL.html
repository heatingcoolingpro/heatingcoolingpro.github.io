Permeable products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
