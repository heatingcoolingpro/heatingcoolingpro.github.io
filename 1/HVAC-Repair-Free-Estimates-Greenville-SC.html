<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Greenville SC</h3>
<p>As one of the most important financial investments and pieces of equipment in your house, it pays to keep track of just how efficiently and effectively your warm air oil or natural gas furnace is running. You need to understand when to replace it before it costs you more in repairs than a new purchase or if it becomes unsafe. A comfy and healthy  home environment needs an energy-efficient and safe heater. One that heats the house without utilizing large amounts of energy which doesn't endanger the indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
