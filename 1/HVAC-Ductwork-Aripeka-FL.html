<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products.
