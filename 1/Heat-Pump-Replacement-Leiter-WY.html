<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Leiter WY</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel.
