<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
