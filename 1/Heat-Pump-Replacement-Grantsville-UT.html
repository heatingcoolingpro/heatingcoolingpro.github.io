If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
