<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
