I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
