<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
