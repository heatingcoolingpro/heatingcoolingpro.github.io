<p>Expert heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
