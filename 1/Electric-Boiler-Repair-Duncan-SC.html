<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC.
