<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Huron CA</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I must state it does the job rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool off your house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
