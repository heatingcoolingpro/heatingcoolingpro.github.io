<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
