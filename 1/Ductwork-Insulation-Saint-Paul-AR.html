<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
