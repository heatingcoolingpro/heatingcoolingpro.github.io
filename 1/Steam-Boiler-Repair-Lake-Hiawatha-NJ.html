<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

He also got rid of the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor system and advised an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received an in-depth email report of the assessment laying out all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a possession to Waychoff's and I extremely recommend him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
