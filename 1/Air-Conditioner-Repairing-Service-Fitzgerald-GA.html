<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
