<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
