When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to worry about a thing.<p>

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
