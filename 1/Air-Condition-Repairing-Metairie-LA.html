Since they only partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain.

<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
