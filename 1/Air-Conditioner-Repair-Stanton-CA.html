<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
