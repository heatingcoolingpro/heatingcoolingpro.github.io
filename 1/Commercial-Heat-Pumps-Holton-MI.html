<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The growing interest in smart homes, in which heating and air conditioning systems can be managed from another location, could be another potential opportunity for sales. According to the marketplace research firm Statista, home penetration in the U.S. wise home market is already at 33 percent and is anticipated to reach 54 percent by 2023. A service plan for an HVAC company that plans to pursue this opportunity needs to show a high level of knowledge about clever house HVAC products and customer adoption.<p>
