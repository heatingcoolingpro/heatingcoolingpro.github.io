When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy.

In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
