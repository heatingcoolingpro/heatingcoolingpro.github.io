The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Tierra Amarilla NM?</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing clever innovation. Martin stated the company can establish a dashboard within the structure's controls that will provide information on its systems to enable real time presence, providing the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be provided to any commercial customer, not just throughout new building and construction.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
