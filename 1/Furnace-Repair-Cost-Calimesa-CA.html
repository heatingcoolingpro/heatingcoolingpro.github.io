<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
