<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
