After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and positioned properly. Attempt moving it away from direct sunshine considering that this may affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature in your house. If this happens, your thermostat will shut off the furnace prematurely and leave your home feeling cold.
