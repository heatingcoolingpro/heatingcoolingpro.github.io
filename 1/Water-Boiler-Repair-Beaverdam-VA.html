<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which generally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
