<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Monroe IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such factors include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
