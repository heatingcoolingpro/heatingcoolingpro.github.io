Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>

The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
