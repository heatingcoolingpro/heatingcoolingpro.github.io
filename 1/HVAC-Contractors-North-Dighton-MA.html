<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved issues. I would recommend this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
