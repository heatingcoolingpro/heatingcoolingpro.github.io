<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Newfield NJ</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I need to state it does the job rather well.

The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
