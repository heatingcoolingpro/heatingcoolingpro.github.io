<p>Chemical toxins: Unstable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., office devices; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.
