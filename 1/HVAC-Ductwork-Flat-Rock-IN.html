<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
