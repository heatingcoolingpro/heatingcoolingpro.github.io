<p>In-floor heater can come with specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't seem to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. Because they heat surface areas and not the air itself, in-floor heater are not prone to this problem. Furthermore, given that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, registers and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can reduce the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
