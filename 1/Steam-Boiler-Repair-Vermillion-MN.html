Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
