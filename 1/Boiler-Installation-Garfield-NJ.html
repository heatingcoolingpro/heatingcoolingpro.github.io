<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
