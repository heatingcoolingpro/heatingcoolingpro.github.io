<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a home. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be heated in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, consequently cooling a home by eliminating heat.

<p>More frequently, however, detectives will need to come to the building to perform personal interviews with occupants, to look for possible sources of the problems, and to examine the style and operation of the ventilation system and other structure features.
