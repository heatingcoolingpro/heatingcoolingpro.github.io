<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
