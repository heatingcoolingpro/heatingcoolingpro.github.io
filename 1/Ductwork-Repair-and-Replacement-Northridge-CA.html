<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>The residential or commercial properties and structure of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
