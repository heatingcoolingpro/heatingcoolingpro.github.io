<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently.
