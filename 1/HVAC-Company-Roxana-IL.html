<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
