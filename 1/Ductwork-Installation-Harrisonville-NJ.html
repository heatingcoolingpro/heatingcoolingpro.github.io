<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
