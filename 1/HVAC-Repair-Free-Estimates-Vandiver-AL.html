<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Vandiver AL</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
