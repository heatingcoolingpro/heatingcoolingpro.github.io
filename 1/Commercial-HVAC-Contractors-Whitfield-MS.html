<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
