<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Brookhaven MS</h3>
<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperatures in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated lifespan of 15 years. Your heater will work hard for you, but like your cars and truck, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your guarantee undamaged.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
