<h3>Electric Furnace in Kiowa CO</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
