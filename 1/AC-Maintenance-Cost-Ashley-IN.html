<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
