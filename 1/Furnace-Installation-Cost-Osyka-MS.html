Porous materials, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
