<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
