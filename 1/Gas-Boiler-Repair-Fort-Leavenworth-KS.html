<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Fort Leavenworth KS</h3>

<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Fort Leavenworth KS</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PREPARES: Your HVAC system is a financial investment that pays for itself over the years, but just if you protect it to the best of your capability. Fortunately, this does not need to be a chore! When you register for a Keefe's maintenance plan, we take care of everything. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual examinations, marked down diagnostics, top priority service, and fantastic offers on replacements and repairs. Choose between our bronze, silver, gold, and platinum plans, and we'll supply you with the highest level of defense and maintenance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
