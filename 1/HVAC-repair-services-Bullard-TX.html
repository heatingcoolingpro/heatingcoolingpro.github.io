<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
