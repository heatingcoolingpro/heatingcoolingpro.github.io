<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
