<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
