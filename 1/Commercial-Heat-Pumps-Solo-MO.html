<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>The basic duties of an HVAC technician include setting up, keeping, and repairing heating, air, and refrigeration systems.
