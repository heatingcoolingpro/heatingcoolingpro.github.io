<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Mellott IN</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
