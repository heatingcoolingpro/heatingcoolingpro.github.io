<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
