All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which normally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
