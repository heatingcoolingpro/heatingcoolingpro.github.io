<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
