<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.)
