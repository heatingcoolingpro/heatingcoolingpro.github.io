<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The essential part of your cooling is the outdoor unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your home and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage during the winter.

Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
