<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
