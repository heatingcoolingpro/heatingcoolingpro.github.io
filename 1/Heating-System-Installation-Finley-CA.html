Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
