<h3>Cheap AC Units in Justin TX</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
