<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, intend on spending several thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system identifies the labor hours involved to construct the system. When you think about installation costs upwards of $50 per hour, to outfit a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name new furnace or more.<p>
<p>Many AC units include a variety of special features that can even more enhance performance and effectiveness. For instance, property owners might want to try to find one that comes with a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy expenses a lot more. Naturally, more functions suggest greater central air costs.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
