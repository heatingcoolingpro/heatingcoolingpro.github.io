The average home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
