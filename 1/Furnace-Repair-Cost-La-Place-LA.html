<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has actually been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.

Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered due to the fact that overly moist soil may promote the development of bacteria which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
