<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this data may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
