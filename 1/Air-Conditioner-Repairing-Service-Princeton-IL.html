<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
