<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
