<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
