He committed to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
