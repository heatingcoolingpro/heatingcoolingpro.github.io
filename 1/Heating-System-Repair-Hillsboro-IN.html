<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning items, building and construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside pollutants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
