<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the spaces. Many modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
