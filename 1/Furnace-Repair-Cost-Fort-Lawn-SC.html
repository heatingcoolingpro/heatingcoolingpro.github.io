<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
