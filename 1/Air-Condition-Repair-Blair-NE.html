<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined.

Therefore, this may not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
