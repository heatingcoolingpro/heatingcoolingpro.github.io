<p>In addition, HVAC businesses often need to pay licensing and certification charges, so make certain to take a look at the specific HVAC licensing requirements in your state.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
