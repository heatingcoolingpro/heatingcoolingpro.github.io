<p>All houses need effective ventilation.

Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
