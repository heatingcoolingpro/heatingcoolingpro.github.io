<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow limitation will decrease the system's performance. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified.
