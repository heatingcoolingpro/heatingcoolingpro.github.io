<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
