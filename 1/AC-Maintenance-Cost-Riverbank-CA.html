High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>If you operate in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands. You may likewise be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil very near homes may be infected from lead paint on the outside of the building. Soil by roads and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before getting in the house. If you deal with lead in your task or a pastime, change your clothes before you go house and clean these clothes individually. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your children from consuming dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come within.<p>
