Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
