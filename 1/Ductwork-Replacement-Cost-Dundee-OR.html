<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
