<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
