<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best.

A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits use dose-response information which show the health effects of repeated exposure to one particular chemical.
