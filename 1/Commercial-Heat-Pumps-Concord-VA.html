<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
