<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
