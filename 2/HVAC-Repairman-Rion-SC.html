In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States."

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.
