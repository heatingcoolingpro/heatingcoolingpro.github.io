<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust.

Insulation may be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
