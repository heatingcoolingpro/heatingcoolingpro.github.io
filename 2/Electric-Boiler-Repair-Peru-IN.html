<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly seem greater than typical, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right now, not to mention the cash you'll save on repair expenses. You can most likely anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air might likewise be a problem.<p>
