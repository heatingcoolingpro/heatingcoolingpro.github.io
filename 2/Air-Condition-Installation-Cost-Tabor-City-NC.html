<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Tabor City NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
