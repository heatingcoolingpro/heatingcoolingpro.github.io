<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and useful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better offer, for remarkable service.

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
