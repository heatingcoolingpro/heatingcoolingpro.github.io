<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
