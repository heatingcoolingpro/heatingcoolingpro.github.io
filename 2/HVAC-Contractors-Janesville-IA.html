<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>

Roughly 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
