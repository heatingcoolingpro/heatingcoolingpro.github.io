<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Carolina Beach NC Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
