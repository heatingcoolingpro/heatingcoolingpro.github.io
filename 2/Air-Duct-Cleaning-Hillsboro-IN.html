<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Hillsboro IN</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
