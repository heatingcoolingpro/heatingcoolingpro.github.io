<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, smoking cigarettes, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in produced items. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Sorrento FL</h3>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is incorrectly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including polluted soil tracked within, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
