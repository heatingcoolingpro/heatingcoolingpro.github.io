Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>

This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
