<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
