<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electricity. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
