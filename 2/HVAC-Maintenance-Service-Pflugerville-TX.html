<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
