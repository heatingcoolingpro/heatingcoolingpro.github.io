<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an essential problem to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution research studies have determined several impurities that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion products, unpredictable natural compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>A split ac system includes two primary parts - a compressor located outside and a within air outlet unit.
