<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Since they only partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a dependable ways of minimizing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more information on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below.

Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.
