<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
