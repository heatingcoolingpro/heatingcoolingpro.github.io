<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>

If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
