<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit.

However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level.
