<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
