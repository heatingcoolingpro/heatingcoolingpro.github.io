What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
