<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
