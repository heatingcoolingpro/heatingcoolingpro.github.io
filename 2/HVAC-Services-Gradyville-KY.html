<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
