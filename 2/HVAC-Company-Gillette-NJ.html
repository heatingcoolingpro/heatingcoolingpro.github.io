During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually checked at least. This inspection is an important element of HVAC maintenance. You will not observe a problem till it stops working in the middle of winter season if you don't get your system checked.

Regular examination and maintenance also helps keep it in good shape and extends its life.<p>
