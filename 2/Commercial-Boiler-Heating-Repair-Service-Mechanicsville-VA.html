<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
