You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.
