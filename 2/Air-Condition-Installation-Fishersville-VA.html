<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often develop in ductwork, restricting air flow. Given that ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really challenging at first, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge.

<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency.

If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
