<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The main hazard of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good idea to think of energy effectiveness. By choosing a central AC system that has as high of an effectiveness rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run. Performance ratings need to be labeled with all units. While efficient systems may cost more, going with an Energy Star-rated appliance is an excellent method to enjoy additional comfort.<p>
