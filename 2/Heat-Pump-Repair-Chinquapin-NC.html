<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

Fetuses, infants, elderly individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be particularly conscious carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>
