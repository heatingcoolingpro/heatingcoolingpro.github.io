<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants might be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning items, construction carpets, activities and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless splits allow you to avoid the need for a full duct system like most other cooling systems need. You will also delight in a far more versatile system in terms of installation and cost. And due to the fact that each indoor unit has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when one person would prefer it a little warmer in a various room.<p>
