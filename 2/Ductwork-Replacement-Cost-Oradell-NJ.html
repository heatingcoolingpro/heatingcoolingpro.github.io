<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
