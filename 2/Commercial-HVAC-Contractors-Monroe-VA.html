There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
