<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
