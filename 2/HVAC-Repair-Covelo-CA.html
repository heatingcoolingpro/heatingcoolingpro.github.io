Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater.

<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
