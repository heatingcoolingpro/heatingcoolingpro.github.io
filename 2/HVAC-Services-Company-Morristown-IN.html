<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work.

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
