<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from starting to end were extremely expert, considerate and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, considering that it is secured inside your home.
