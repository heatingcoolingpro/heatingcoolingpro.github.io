<h3>AC Service in Sellersburg IN</h3>
<p>Required air systems are the most typical heater types on the marketplace, but they're not constantly the best choice for every house. If you're looking for a new heating system for your home, you need to have a look at a few of the other alternatives available before picking a system that may not fit your requirements best. Radiant heating, for example, may be a much better fit for your requirements.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
