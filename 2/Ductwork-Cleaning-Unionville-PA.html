<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing brand-new equipment.<p>
