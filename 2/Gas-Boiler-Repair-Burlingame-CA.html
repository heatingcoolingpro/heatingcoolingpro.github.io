<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off.

In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
