<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
