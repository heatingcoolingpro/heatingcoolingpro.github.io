<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not just will blocked vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can likewise cause duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT an excellent concept. You won't save any money and will end up triggering more issues for your heater.<p>
