<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
