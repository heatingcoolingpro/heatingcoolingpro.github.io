<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than numerous heatpump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the design you purchase. One of the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperature levels than other heating options. This indicates it can warm up your house to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
