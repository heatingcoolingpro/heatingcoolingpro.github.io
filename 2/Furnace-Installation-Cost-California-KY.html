<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
