<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant results are treatable and typically short-term. Often the treatment is simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized.

<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions.

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically vital to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs.
