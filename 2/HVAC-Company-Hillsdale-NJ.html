Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with problems. I would advise this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.
