<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
