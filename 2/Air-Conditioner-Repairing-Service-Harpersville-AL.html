<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
