<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
