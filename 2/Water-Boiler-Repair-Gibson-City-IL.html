<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.

Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
