<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
