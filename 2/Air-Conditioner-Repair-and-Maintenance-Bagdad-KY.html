<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Bagdad KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes.
