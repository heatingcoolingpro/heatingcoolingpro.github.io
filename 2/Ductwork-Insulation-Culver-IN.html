<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
