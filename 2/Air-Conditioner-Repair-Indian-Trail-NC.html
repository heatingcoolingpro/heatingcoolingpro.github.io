<p>While individuals spend 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has actually not been a large focus of attention for facilities management and occupants up until just recently.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be warmed in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a couple of feet listed below ground.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
