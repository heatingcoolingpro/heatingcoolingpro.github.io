And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Geismar LA</h3>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.
