<p>Specialist heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
