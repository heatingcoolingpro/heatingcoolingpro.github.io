<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system.

<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Hamburg PA</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air conditioning, you have a couple of alternatives when it comes to central heating unit.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
