<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
