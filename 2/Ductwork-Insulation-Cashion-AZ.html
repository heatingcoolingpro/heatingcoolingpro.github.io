<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
