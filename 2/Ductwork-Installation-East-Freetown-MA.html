<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
