<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention.
