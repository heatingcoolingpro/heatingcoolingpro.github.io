In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
