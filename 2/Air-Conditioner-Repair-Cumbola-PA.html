<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
