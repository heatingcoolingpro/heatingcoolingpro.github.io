<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly.

Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
