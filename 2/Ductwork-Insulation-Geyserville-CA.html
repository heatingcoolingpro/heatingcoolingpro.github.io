A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption.

More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
