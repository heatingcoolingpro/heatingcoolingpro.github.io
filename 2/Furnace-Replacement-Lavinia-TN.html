<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, reducing their efficiency over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
