<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not a service.

Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
