<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which automatically closed down the heatpump if temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
