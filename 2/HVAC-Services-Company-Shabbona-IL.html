<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about 10 years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are extremely well-informed and expert. Expenses are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser today. Since the cost was obviously reasonable, I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
