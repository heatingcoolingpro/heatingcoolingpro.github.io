<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
