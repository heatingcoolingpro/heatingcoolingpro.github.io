<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same period. Basically, SEER offers more data based on how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
