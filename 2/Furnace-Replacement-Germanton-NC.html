<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
