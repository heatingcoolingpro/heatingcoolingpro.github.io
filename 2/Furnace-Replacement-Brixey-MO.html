<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
