<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Harwood Heights IL</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
