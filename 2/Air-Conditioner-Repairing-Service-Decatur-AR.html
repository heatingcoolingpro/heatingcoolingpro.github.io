<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
