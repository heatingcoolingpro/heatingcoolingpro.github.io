The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
