<p>Because things ran smoothly without any sound, I was really pleased in the start. Moreover, I saw noticeable modifications in my electricity bills. After two years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it examined and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
