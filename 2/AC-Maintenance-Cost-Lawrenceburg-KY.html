Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply radiant systems.

<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Lawrenceburg KY</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved concerns. I would advise this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
