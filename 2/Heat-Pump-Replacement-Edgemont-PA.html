Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
