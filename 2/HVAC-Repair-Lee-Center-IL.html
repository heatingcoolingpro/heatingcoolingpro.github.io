When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Lee Center IL</h3>

Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you have actually given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
