<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
