<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Lodi NJ</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.
