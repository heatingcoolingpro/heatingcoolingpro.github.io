Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified agent from a service or retailer to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the a/c system. A voided warranty will not do you any excellent should the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the start and work with a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
