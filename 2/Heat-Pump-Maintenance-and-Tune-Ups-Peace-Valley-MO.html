<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
