They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My wife said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have met in a long period of time.
