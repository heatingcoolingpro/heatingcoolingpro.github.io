<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
