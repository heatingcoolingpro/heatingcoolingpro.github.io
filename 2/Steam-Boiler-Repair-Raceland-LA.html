A dehumidifier (and air conditioning unit during summer season) helps in reducing moisture in indoor air and efficiently manages allergens, Lang says. An air conditioner also reduces indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -sufferers.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have actually found out how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
