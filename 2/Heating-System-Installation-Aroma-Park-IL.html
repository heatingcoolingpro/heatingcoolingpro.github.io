<p>Buildings are designed or meant to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to improve their performance, durability, or appearance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps dramatically change structures in manner ins which might be necessary to their own integrity or their effect on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We might find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the techniques utilized by scientists studying communities, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
