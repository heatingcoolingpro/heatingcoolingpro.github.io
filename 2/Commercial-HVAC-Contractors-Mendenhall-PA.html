<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
