<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Ambler PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
