<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).

Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>

An expert technician will inspect the thermostat during the annual maintenance to ensure the real temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature level, the technician needs to inspect the thermostat's performance or examine the entire HVAC system.<p>
