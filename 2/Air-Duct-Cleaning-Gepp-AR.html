<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
