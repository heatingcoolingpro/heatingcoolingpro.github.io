<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
