<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in West Haverstraw NY - The Benefits</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
