<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
