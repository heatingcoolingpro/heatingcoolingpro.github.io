<p>Heat pumps are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that a lot of Seattleites will only use moderately, but due to the fact that heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
