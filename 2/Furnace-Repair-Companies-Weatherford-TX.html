<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
