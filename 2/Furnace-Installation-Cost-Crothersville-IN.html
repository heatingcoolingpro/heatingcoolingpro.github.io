<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the producer's directions.<p>
