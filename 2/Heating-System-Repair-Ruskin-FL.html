<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Ruskin FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
