<p>Are you including a new space onto your house? Possibly you have a space with distinct heating and cooling difficulties, such as rooms that constantly seem to be too hot or too cold.

EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to secondhand smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
