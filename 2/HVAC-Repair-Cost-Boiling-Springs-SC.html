<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>

Any interference or disturbance in the circulation of electricity makes the system inoperable. This is one of the downsides to installing an electric convected heat system. However, presuming they are set up properly and correctly taken care of, the likelihood of them having problems is small.<p>
