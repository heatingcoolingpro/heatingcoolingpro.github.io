<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
