<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do recognize an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating system and choose to install it in your home, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these expenses can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can anticipate to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heater where you live.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
