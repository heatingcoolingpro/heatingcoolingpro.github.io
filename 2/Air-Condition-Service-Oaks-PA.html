<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
