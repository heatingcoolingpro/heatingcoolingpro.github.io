<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and altering the air filters is one of the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
