After two years, things started to alter. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. However then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
