<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
