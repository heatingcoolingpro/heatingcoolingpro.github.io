<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

This makes geothermal heating a dependable and available source of energy.<p>
