Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
