<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
