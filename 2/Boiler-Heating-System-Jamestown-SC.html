<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

Load determining is described as the Manual J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
