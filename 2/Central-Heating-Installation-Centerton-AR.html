<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Centerton AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
