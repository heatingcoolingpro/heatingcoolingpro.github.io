<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
