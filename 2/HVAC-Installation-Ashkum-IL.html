<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
