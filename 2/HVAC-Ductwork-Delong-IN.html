<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very quickly.

Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
