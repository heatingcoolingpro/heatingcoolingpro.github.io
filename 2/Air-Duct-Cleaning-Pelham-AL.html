<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not a solution.

Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was.
