<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Edwardsville KS</h3>
<p>When you and your household walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold during the winter season or too warm in locations during the summertime? Whether you're having an issue with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Comfort, Inc. has the services and products you need.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
