Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>

Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is improperly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
