<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>5. Odor great naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney scent with a tidy kitchen area or clean artificial scents in laundry items and air fresheners discharge lots of different chemicals into the air.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
