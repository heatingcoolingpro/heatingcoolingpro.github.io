Not just will obstructed vents and signs up impact your comfort, they can also lead to duct leaks due to extreme atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT an excellent concept. You will not save any extra money and will end up causing more problems for your heater.<p>

High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long haul. Costs for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric furnaces start at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>
