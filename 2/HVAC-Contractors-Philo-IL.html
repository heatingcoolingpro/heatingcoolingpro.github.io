<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
