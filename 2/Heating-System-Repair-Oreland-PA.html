<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less effective.
