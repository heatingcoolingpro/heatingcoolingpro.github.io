<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
