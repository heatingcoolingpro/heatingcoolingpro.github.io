<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that need to be constantly provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
