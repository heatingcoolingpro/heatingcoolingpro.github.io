Lots of typical structure materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not constantly ideal due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is typically suggested instead.<p>
