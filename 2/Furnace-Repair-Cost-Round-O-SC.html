<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Round O SC</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
