For instance, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed restricted plumbing work for select clients. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its abilities, enabling a boosted value proposal for a broader set of clients.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
