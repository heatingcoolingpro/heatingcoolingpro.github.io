<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
