<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
