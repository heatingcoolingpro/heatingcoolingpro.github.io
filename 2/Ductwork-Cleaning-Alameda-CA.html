<h3>Truth About Alameda CA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
