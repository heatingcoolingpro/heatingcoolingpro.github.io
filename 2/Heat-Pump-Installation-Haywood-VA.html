<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>To be honest, few of the centers managers who use our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us because of that. More often than not they were at first thinking about remotely monitoring some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't up until later, as they continued working with us, that they learnt more about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to offer a much healthier, safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative repercussions associated with indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any brand-new heating system in a house, it is needed to re lower the energy and assess load of the home. A more energy effective house will not just lower the cost of a brand-new system and energy bills, but it will considerably improve the convenience of your house. Before we design and install any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic enhancements normally include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise a number of certified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
