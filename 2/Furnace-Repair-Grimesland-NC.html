<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
