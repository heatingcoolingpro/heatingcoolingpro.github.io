<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant flooring heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or modified. Any disturbance or interruption in the flow of electrical energy makes the system unusable. This is one of the downsides to setting up an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, presuming they are installed properly and properly looked after, the probability of them having problems is little.<p>
