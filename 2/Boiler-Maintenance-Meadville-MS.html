<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants.

After that, you can make a much better ideal decision on how typically your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter need changing more often.<p>
