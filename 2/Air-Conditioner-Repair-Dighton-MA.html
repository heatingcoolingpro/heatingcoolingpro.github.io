Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, typically with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
