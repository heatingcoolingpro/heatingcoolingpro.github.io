<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions ideal for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings differ, but often consist of very warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive steps include changing regular warm water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, assessing center design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic screening in suspect areas.<p>

<p>Heatpump are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that most Seattleites will only use sparingly, however because heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not toxic, however might become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
