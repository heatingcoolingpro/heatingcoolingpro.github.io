<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
