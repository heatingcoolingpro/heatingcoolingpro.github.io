(He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service.
