<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
