<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are many other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
