<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial impacts.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
