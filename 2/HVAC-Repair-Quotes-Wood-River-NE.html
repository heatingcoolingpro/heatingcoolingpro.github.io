<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Wood River NE</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
