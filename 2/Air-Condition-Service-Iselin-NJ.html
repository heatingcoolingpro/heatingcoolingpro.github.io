<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
