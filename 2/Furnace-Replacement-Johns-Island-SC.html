<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
