<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step.

Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
