<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
