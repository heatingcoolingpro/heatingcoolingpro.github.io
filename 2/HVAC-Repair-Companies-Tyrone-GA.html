<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
