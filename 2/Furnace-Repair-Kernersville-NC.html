<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, stability Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house.

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they concern perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
