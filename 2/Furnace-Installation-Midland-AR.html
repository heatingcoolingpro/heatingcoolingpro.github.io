<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
