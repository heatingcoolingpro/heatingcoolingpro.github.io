<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
