<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed very quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same).

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
