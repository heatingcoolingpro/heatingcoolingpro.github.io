<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
