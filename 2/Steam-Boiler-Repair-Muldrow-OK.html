<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
