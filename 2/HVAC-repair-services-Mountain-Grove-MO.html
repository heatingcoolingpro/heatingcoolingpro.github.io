<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
