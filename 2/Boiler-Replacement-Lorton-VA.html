<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Lorton VA?</h3>

These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts implies you're less likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
