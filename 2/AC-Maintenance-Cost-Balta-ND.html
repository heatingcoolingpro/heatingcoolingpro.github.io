<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
