<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
