To make sure the system you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to figure out the precise type of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
