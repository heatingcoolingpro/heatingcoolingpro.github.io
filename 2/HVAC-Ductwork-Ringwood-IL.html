Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
