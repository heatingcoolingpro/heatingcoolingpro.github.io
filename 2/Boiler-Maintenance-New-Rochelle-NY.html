<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON.

<h3>AC Compressor in New Rochelle NY</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators.
