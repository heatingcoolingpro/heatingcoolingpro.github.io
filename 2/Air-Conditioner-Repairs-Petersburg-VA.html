<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
