<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered fantastic client service at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
