<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
