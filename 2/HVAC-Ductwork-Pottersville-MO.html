<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
