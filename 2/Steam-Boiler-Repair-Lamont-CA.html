<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>If you want to conserve yourself money and time over the long term, having yearly maintenance performed on the furnace is a great concept.

If you arrange the maintenance check out soon before the normal heating season, your furnace will be clean and running as efficiently as possible throughout the upcoming winter season. An efficient system means fewer repairs, so you won't have to be as diligent when it comes to searching for indications of difficulty and the monthly costs will be less.
