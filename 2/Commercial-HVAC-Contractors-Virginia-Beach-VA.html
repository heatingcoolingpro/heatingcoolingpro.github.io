Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment.
