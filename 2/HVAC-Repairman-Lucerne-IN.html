<h3>Heating Systems in Lucerne IN</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
