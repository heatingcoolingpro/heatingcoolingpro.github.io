If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
