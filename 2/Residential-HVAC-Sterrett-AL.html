<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Humid and wet conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can trigger respiratory concerns like allergic reactions and asthma. Depending upon your location, the hot summer months can cause especially damp conditions.

There are a range of humidifier options that will help maintain constant humidity levels and develop comfortable living conditions in your home.<p>
