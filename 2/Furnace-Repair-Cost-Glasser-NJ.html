<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
