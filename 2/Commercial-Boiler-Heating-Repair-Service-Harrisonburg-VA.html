<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
