<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become a crucial concern to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination studies have recognized numerous impurities that can be present in indoor air.

<p>Having actually yearly maintenance performed on the furnace is a good concept if you want to save yourself time and cash over the long term.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>For pollutants besides radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms or indications of bad ventilation and specific sources or contaminants have actually been recognized as possible causes of indoor air quality issues. Checking for lots of pollutants can be pricey. Before monitoring your house for contaminants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings.<p>
