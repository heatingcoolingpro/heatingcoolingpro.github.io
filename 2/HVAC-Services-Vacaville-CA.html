<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen. Most of the times, the belt is poorly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
