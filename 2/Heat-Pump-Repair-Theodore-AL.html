<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not position a significant health threat by themselves, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening.

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and repaired extremely rapidly.

<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to supply threshold notifies. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to resolve the circumstance right away.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
