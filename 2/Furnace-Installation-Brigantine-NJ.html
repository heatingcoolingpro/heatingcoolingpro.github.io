<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance benefit. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
