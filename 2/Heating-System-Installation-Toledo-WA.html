These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.

<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
