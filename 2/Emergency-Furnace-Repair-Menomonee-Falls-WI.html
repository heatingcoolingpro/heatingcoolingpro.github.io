<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
