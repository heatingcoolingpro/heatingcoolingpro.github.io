<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary freedom.

HVAC business owners ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
