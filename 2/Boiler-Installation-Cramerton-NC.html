<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians believed they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
