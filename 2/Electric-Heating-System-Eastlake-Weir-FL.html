<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Eastlake Weir FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many people.<p>
