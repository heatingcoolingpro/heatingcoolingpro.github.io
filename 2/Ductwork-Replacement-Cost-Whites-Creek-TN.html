<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>We have actually been incredibly happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished annual maintenance of our system).
