The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Do not stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply might require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital display screen on. If 24 volts isn't obtained, you'll get a blank screen. There are many different reasons that your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you may be having trouble with your Nest smart thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers first. You need to have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace, check. Often the furnace switch is accidentally shut off by somebody increasing in the attic. There is a furnace switch that in some cases goes malfunctioning. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are numerous wires in your furnace.<p>
