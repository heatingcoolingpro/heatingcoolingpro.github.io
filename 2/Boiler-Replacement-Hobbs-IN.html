<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if essential, update the building envelope.

Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
