<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
