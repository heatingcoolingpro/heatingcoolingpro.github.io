<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heaters While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the 2 types.
