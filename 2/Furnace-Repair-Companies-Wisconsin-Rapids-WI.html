<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
