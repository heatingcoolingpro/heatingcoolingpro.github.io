<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. There are a number of style techniques in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems.
