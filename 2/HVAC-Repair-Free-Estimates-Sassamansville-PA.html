<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that the majority of Seattleites will only use moderately, but since heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds! Not only are heat pumps practical, they are exceptionally energy efficient, too. If a heatpump is in your future, the very best time to install cooling in your house may very well be when your heating system breaks down.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
