<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
