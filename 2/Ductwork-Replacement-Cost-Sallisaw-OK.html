<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.
