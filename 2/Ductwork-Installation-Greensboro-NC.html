<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
