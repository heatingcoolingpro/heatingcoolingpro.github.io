Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
