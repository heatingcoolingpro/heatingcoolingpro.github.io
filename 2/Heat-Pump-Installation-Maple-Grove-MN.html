<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
