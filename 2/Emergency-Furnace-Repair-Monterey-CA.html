All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
