<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Fort Myers FL</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>The main reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services used.
