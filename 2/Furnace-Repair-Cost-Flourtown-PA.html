<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
