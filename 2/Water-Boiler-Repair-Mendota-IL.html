<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

We just recently had a concern with an older system and called to set up a day and time to have it examined. They sent James Bell and he was great. He took the time to discuss our choices cost differences and was extremely well-informed expert and handy. Delighted consumers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>

When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for substantial health problems.<p>
