<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
