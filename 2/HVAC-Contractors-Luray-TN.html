<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
