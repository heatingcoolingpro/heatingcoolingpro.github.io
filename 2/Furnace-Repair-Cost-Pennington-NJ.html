<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working.
