The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
