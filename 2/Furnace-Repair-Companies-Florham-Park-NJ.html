Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
