<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. Sometimes it's not a major issue, and your system may merely require some maintenance work.

Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
