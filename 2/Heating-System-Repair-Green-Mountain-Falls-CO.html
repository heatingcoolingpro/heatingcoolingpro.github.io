There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
