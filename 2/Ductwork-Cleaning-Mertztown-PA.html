<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
