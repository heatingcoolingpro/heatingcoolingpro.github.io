<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
