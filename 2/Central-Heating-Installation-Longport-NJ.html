<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
