<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably lowers direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect change, typically indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you acquire a new gas range or variety. Never use a gas range to heat your house. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
