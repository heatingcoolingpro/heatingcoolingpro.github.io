<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any new heating system in a house, it is needed to re evaluate and decrease the energy load of the house. A more energy effective house will not only decrease the cost of a brand-new system and energy bills, but it will considerably improve the comfort of your house. Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic improvements normally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest several qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for references.<p>
