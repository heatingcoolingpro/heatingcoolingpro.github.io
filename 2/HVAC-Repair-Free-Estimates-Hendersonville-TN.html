<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Over the past few years, there has actually been some promotion recommending that houseplants have actually been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no evidence, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants get rid of significant amounts of contaminants in workplaces and homes.
