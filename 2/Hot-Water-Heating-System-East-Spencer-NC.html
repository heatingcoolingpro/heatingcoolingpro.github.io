<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
