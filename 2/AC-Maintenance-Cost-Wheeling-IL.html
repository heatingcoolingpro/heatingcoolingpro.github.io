<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
