PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently.

The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
