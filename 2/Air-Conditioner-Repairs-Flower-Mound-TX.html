<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
