<p>There is no easy answer, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the existing system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit. However, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>
