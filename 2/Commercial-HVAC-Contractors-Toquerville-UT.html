<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same period.
