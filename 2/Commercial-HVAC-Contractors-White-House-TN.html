<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
