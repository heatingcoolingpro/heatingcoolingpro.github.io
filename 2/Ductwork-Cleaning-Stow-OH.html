<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in really winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will merely run more difficult to keep a warm environment for your home when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact one of our service technicians if you need clearness on this problem.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and effectiveness if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
