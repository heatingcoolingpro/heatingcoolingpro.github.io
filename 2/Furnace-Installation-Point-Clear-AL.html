<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, nowadays. While many people assume contamination is simply an outside problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe adequate about exposure to all the things we position in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right away, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies discovered levels of about a lots common natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside houses than outdoors, no matter whether the houses were located in rural or highly commercial areas. Additional GROUP studies indicate that while people are using products containing natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high toxin levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>

The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
