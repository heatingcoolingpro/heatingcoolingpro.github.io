<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
