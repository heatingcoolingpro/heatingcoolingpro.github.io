<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Frazier Park CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
