<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the maker's directions, specifically instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
