Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
