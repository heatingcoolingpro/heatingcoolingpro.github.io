<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
