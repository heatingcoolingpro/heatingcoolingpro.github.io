Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
