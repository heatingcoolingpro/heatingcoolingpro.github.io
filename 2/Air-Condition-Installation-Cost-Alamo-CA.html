<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
