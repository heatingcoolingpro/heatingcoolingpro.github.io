Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing hot and cold air throughout your home, offering a comfortable environment in every room.

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
