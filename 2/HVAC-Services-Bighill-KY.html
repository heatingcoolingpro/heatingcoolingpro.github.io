<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE ratings frequently come with higher price tags.

For many temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter season, having a very high ranked heating unit is not always required.<p>

It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
