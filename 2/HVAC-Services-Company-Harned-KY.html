<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
