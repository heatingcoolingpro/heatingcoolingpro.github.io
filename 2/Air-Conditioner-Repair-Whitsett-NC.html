They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My other half said that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have fulfilled in a very long time.
