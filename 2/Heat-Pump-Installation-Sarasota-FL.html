For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out repairing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me.
