<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time.
