<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
