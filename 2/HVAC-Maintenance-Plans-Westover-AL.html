<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
