<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
