<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
