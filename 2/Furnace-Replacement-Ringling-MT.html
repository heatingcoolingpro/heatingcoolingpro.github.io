There have been awkward noises. I got it fixed and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then realized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
