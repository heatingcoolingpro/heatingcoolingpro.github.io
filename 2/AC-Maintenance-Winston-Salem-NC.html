<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
