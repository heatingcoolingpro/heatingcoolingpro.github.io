<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Many elements impact IAQ. These aspects include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, particular contaminants like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) may cause poor IAQ.<p>
