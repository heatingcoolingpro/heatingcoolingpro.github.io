<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
