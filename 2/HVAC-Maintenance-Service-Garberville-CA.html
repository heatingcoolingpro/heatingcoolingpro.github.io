<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heating systems can heat your house. Honestly, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
