<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.

If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c devices. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
