<h3>Residential HVAC in Bellevue KY</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
