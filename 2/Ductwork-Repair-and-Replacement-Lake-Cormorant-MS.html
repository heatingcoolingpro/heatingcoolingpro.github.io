<h3>AC Service in Lake Cormorant MS</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed really rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning system isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, think about a whole house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for greater comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
