Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into account not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
