<p>Today's house convected heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a restroom floor or be set up throughout the entire sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
