<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as healthcare facilities and skyscrapers, automobiles such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office devices, cleaning items, building activities, carpets and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
