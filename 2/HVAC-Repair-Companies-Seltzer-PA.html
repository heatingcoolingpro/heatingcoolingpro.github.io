<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that a lot of Seattleites will just use moderately, however since heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

If a heatpump remains in your future, the very best time to install cooling in your home might extremely well be when your heater breaks down.<p>

The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
