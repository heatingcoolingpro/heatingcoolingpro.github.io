<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Three Rivers MI</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget-friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
