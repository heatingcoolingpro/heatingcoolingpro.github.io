<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
