Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead.
