<p>It's a fact that a new furnace for your house is one of the more considerable expenses associated with home ownership. But, it needs to also be seen as a long-lasting investment. All of the latest heaters are far more energy-efficient than those set up even twenty years ago.

<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
