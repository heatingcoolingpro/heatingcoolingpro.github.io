<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
