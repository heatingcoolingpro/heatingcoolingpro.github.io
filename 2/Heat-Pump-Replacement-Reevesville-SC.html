You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the outcome of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation.
