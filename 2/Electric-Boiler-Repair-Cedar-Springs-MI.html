<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency.

By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
