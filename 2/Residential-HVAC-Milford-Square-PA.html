<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
