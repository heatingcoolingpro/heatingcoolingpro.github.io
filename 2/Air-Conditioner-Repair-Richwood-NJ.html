But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (particularly at night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that could prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
