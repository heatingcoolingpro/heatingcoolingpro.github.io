<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
