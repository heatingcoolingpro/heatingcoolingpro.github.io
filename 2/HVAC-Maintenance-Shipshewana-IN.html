<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have.

Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
