<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture.
