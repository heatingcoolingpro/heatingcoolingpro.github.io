<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally triggered by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main issue in majority the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Many AC systems come with a variety of unique features that can even more enhance efficiency and performance. For example, property owners may want to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter requires to be altered.
