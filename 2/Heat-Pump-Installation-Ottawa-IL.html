<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing.

<h3>Radiant Heating System in Ottawa IL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our alternatives did an exceptional job in making certain we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The professionals who installed the new system were professional and fast, while taking some time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
