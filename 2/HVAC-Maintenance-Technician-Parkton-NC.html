<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids may have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
