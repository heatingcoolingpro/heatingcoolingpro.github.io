<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but numerous use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
