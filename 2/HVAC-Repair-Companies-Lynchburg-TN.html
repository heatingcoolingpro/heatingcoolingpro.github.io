<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
