If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heatpump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending on the model you purchase.
