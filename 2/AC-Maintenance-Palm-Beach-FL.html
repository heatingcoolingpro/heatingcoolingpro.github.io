<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and shown to examine structure ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These treatments vary from advanced tracer gas methods used predominantly in building research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by building operators.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions.
