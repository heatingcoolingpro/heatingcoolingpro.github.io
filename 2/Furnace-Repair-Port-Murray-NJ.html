<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
