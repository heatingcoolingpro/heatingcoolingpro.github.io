<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers.
