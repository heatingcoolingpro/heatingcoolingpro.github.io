<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
