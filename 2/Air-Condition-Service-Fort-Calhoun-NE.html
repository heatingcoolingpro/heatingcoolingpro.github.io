<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Fort Calhoun NE</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans should be installed in all restrooms and cooking areas. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are resilient and peaceful. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for a sufficient amount of time. An excellent general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
