Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
