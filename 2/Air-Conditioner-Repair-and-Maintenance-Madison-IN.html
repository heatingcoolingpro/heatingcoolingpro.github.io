<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
