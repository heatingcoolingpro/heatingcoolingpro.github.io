<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-efficient solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards generally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building (houses normally utilize in between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.
