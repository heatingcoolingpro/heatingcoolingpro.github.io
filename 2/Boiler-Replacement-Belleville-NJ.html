<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space a/c supplies maximum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
