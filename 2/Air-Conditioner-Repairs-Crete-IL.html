<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
