<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if essential, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
