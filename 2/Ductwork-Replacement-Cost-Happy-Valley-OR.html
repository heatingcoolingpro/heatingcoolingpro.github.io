<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Happy Valley OR</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants produced by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
