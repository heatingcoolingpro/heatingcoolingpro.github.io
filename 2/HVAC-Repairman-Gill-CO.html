Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
