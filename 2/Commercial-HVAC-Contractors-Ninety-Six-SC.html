<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators.

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
