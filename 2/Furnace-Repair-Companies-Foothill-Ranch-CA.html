<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
