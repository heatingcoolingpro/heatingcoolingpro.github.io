<h3>Effective Methods for Furnace Cleaning in Walnut IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
