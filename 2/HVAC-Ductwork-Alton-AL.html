<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
