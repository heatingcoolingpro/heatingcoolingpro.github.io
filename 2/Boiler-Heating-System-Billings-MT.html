<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, causing holes and fractures.
