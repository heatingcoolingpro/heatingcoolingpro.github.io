<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation company completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
