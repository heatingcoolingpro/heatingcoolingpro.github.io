<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
