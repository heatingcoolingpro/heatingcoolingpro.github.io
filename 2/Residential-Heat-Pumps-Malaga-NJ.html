We can assist you identify what size and scale of cooling installation will keep your house cool and comfy all summer season long.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside.
