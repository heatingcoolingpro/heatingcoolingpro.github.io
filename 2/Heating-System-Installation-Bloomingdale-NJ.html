<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Pushed wood items made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).
