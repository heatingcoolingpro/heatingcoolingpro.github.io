<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in San Marino CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
