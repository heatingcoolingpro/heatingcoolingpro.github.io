<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration technologies are ending up being more typical as readily available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages.
