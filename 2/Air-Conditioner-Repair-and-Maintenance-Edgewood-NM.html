<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can imply considerable savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial price of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
