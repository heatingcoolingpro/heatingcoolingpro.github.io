<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed.
