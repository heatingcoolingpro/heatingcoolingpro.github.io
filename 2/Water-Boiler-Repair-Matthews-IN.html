<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Matthews IN?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
