<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
