<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage. Since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
