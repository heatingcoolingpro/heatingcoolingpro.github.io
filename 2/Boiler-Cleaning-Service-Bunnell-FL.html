Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
