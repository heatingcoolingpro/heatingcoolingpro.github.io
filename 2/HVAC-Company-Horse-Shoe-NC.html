<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Horse Shoe NC</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofs, walls, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heat pump must be free of all obstructions and debris.

An expert maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to guarantee all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
