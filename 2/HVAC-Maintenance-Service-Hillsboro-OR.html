<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
