<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
