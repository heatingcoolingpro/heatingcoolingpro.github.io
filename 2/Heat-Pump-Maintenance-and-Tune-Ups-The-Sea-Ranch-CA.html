<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
