<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Federal Way WA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare events.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and repaired very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
