<p>Make sure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers affect your convenience, they can likewise cause duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
