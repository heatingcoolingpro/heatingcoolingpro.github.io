<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of children in the United States."

<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
