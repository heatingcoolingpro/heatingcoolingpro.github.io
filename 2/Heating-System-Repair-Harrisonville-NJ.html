<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
