<p>We take a look at hints before we offer guidance to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
