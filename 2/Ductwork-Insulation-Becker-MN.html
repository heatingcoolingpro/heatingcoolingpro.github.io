<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely monitors energy usage and temperatures in stores to minimize costs (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate outside of an appropriate variety that might avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
