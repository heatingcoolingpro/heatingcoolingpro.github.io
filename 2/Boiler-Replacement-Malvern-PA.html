<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Malvern PA</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
