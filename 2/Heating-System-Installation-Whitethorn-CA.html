After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
