<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
