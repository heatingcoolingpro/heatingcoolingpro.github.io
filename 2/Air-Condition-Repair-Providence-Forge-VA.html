Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
