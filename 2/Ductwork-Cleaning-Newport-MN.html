<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
