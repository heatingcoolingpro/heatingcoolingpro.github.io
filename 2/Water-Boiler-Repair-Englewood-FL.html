<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
