A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
