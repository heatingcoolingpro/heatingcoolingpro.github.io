<p>Air pollutants can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
