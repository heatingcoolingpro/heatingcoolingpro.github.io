<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
