While contaminants frequently discovered in indoor air can cause many damaging effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. People also respond extremely differently to exposure to indoor air toxins.

<p>A matched system is the combination of products that make up your HVAC system. Depending on your area, a matched system can be made up of the following: an air conditioning system and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an air conditioning system and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By integrating parts that are made to work seamlessly together, you can create a more effective ideal system.<p>
<p>During regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can develop on internal components. Airborne elements from regular household products and surface areas can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC equipment. Left unattended, these issues can cause loss of effectiveness and worse, breakdown of part products and a much shorter furnace life-span Gradually, important parts like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start corroding, causing lowered performance.<p>
