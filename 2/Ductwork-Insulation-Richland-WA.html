In the summer season, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat.

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
