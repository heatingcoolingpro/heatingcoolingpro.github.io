<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
