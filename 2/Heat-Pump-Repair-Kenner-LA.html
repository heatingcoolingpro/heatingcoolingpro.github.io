<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
