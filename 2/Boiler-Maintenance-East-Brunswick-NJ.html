ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
