<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
