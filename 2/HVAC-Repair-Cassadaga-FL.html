<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated professionals perform much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Since they're inexpensive, an ethical company does not exploit low-cost labor opportunities simply. Low-cost craftsmanship is normally substandard craftsmanship, and it never ever assists a company construct long-term relationships with customers.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate problems-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three strategies listed below might be suitable.<p>
