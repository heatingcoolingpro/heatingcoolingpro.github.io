<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

By being familiar with more about an HVAC service provider before you call, you'll know whether they are the very best company to deal with the service or concern you require them for.<p>
