They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to buy it. My better half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a long time.
