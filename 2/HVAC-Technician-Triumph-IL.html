<h3>Electric Heating System in Triumph IL</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, compressor, and evaporator are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing or on a concrete piece next to the house's structure. This type of air conditioner likewise is utilized in little commercial structures.

Packaged a/c frequently include electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of a/c unit and central heater eliminates the requirement for a different furnace inside.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
