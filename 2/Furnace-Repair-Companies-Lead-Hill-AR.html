<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components.
