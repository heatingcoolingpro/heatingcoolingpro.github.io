<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
