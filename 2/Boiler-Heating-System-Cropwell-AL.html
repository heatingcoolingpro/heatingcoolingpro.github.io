Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered just a few feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, thereby cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer dependable and constant heating & cooling.<p>
