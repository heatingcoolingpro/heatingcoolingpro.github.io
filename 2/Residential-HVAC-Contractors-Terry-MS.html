<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
