<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
