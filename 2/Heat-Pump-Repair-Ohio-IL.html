A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
