<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Donalsonville GA?</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
