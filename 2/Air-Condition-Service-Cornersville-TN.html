The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we dealt with concerns.
