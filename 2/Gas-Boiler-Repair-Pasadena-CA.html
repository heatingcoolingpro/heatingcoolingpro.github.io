<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
