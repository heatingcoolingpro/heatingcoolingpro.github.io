<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
