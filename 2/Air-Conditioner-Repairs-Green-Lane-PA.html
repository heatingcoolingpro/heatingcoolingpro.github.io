<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to resolve the situation immediately.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, humans breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not harmful, but may end up being harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs might also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the whole workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
