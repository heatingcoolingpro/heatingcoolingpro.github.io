<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
