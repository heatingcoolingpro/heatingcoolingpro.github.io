<h3>Ventilation Systems in Camp Lejeune NC</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
