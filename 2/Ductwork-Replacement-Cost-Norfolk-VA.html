The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however many use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution. If the existing system has not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
