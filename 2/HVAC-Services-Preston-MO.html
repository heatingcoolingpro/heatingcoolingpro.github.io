<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Preston MO</h3>
<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, because it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
