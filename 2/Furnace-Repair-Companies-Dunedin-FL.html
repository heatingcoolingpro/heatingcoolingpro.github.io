<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
