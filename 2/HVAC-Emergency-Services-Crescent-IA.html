Some sources, such as constructing products, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants basically constantly. Other sources, associated to activities like smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies launch contaminants intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or incorrectly used products can release higher and often hazardous levels of contaminants inside your home.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
