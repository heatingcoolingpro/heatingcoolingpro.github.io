<p>Immediate impacts might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.)

Evaluation of this data might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
