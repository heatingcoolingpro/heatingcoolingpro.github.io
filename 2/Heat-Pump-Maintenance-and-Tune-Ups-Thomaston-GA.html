<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
