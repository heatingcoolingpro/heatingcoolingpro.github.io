<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
