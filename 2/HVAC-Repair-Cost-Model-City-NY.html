Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
