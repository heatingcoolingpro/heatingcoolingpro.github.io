<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home.
