<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
