<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
