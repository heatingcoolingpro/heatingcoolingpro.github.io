<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health effects discussed. However, it is not always true that the results noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too restricted to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transport the heat to the rooms. Many modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
