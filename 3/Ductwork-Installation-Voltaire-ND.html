<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance gos to annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other perks.
