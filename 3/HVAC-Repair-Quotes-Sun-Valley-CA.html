<h3>Everything You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Sun Valley CA</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And A/c is HVAC Contractor providing the best possible Heating and Cooling Repair, maintenance and installation for your home or service in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Isle of Palms South Carolina. You can depend on us to supply you with a system and service that fits your unique requirements and because we have actually installed numerous systems in this location, we have actually made a credibility for getting the job done right the first time.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
