<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
