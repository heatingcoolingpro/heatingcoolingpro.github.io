<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
