<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Louisa VA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the whole surface of a floor heats up the lower half of the room, covering occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature-- in some cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater." To put it simply, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenses.<p>
