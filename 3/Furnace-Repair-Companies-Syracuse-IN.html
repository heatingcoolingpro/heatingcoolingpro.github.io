Winters come with occasional bursts of chilly weather condition that make a touch of heat extremely welcome. From heating and cooling to indoor air quality, Scott's One Hour Air Conditioning & Heating has you covered.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
