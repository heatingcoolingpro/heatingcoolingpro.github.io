<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
