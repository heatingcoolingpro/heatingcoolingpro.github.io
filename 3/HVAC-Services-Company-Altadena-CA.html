<h3>Furnace Company in Altadena CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
