<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
