<h3>HVAC Company in Cheltenham PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
