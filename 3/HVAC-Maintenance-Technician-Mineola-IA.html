<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now.

He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
