<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Blue Ridge VA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is improperly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
