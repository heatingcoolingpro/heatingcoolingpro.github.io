<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges utilized combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part.
