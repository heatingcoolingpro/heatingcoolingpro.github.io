<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Wadsworth IL</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
