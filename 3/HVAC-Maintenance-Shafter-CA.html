<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most underrated HVAC element in your a/c system is the evaporator & condenser coil. When making a huge HVAC decision on replacing your devices, many individuals think the compressor is the only component that matters. The majority of air conditioning replacements take place when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. When the copper or aluminum coils begin to rust, refrigerant leaks occur.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
