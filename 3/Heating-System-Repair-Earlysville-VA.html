<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
