Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure.
