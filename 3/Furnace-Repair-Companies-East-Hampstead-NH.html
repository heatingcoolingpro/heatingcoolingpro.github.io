<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
