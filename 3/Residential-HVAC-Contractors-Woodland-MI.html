<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
