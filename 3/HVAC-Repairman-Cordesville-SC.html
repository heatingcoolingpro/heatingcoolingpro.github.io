<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
