<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
