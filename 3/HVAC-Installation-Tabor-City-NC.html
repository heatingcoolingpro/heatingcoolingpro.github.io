<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside is associated with a higher frequency of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
