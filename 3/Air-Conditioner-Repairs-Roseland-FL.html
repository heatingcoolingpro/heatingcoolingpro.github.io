<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
