Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective.
