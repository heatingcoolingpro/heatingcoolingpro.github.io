<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking cigarettes, family items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in made products.

<p>Rising energy costs are not the only reason for high costs. Heaters frequently lose their effectiveness as they age, specifically if they have actually not been correctly preserved. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to offer the same amount of heat. This will cause your energy costs to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month might be used to help you pay for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. It's time to replace your furnace if there is a significant difference.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
