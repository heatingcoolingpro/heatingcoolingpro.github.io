<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were informative and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for remarkable service.

He included these small however substantial modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump since of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
