<p>Details supplied in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings continuously evolve as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing slightly gradually as it ends up being dirty, then is cleaned, collects dirt once again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be evolving as an outcome of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
