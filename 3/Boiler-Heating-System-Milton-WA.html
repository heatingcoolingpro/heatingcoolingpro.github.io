<h3>Furnace Installation in Milton WA</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's necessary that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be heated up adequately and the system will need to continuously run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating costs.<p>

Fazio Vice President Daniel Mitsch decreased to respond to concerns about the visit.
