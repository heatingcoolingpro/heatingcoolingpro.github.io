<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
