<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
