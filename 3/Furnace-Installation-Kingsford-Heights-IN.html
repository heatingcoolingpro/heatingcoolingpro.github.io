<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
