<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage. Because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
