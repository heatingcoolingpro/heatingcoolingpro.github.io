<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
