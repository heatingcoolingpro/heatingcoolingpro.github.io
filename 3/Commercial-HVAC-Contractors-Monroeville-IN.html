Although temperature levels are frequently in the convenience range, some professional treatments, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F).

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
