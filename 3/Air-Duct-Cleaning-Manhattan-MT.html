<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
