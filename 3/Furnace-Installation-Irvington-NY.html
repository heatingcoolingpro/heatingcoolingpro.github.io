<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Irvington NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
