<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures.

Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
