<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, particularly because we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other benefits. Some companies provide priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
