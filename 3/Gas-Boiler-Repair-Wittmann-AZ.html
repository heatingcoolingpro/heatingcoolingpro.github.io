<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Wittmann AZ</h3>
<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might notice musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans exhale co2, which in little quantities is not harmful, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria might likewise be present within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire office or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
