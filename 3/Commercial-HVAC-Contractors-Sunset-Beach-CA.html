<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Sunset Beach CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs.

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Sunset Beach CA</h3>
<p>We required 2 check outs - Jake came out first and was very knowledgeable and pleasant and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later on and was also educated and nice to talk to. They both did an excellent job. Sabre's workplace personnel is really valuable, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and providing the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Absolutely advise.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
