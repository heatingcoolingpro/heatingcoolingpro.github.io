<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs completely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
