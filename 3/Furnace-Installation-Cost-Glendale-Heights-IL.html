<p>The first a/c and fridges used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Other useful reference materials include items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>

<h3>Repair and Care for Glendale Heights IL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in areas during the summertime? Whether you're having an issue with uneven cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Convenience, Inc. has the product or services you require.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
