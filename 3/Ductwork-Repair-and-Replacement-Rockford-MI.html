The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is critical iin ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.

<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures should not be carried out until these problems have actually been corrected.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
