<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins given off by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
