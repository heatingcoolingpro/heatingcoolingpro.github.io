<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
