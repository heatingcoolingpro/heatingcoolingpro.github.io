Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
