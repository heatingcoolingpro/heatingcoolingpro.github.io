<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>No matter the kind of electric glowing flooring heating system, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or modified. Any interference or disturbance in the circulation of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is one of the drawbacks to installing an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, presuming they are set up correctly and properly taken care of, the probability of them having issues is small.<p>
