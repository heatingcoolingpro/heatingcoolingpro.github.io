<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
