<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
