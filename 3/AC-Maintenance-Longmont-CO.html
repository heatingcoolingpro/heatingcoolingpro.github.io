<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old.

<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To discover odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
