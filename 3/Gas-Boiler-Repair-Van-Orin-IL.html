When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
