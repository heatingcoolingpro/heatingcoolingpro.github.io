Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does supply standards about the most typical IAQ workplace problems.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as an automobile radiator or normal home air conditioning unit does.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
