The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual should be required nearly any maintenance other than regular cleaning.

Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
