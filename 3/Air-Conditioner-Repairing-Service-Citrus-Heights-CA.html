<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
