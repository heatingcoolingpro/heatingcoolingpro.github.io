<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
