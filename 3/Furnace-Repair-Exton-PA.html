<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The main risk of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than the majority of allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
