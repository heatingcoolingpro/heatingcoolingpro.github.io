However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to call in a specialist to inspect and repair the system.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
