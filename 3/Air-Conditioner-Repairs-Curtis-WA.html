<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
