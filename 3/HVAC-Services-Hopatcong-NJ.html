<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
