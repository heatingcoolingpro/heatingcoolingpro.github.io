<h3>AC Duct Repair in Urbana IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
