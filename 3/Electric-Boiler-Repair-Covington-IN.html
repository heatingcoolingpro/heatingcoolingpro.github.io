<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Covington IN</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
