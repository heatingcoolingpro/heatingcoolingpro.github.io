<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very handy in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, consider possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
