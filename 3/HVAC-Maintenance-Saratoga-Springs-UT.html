<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Saratoga Springs UT</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
