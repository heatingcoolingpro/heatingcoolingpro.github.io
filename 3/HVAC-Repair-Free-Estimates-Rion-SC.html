<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues.

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
