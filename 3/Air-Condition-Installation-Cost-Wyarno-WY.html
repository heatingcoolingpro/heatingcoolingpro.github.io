Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
