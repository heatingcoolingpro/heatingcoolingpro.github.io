<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at sensible energy costs. Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor.

Because an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
