<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, consider potential results of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted.

While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
