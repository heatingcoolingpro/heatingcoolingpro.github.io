<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in South Whitley IN</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>If you discover a decrease in heat output, first make sure the air filter is clean and in great condition.
