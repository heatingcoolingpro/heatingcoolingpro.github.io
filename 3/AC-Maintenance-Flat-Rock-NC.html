<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
