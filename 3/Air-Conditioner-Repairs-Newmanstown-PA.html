<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>
