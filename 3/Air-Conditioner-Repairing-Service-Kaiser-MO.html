<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is determined using the same set of temperatures across the board. The average summertime temperature level to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the appropriate SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>That stated, when you talk these factors over with Seattle HVAC specialists, various companies might often recommend different services. This is why it is necessary to obtain as many estimates as possible and likewise to have each contractor describe why she or he believes a particular cooling system is best for your house. Like many complicated situations, there's probably more than one right response. You might even wind up taking an idea from one HVAC contractor, even if he or she is not the person who ends up with the job. You need to also take a look at our quality assurance online client ratings and examines area to see what other Seattle property owners have said about each contractor.<p>

YORK items are backed by a few of the best restricted service warranties in the business, including YORK's factory-backed guarantee.
