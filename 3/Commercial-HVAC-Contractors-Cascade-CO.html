<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
