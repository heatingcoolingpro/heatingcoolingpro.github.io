<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
