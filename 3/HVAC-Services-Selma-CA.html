<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope.

Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
