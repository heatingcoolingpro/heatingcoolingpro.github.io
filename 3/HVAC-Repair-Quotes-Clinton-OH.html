<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
