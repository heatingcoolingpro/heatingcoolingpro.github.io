<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
