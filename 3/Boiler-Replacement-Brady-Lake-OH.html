<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
