<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
