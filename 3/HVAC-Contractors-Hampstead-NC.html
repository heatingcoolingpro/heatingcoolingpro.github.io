<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office equipment; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services offered. If the system is new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost may not be beneficial. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
