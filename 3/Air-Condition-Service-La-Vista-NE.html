<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
