<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their choice.
