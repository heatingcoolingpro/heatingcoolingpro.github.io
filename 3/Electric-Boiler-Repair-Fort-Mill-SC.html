To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

However, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
