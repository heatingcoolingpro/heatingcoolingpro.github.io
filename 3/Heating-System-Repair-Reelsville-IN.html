<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have.

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
