<p>The first a/c unit and fridges employed combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Specific instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often difficult to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to take notice of the time and place the signs take place. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
