When examining your air conditioning equipment to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure.

<h3>HVAC Technician in Glen Ellen CA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I required to call on these people twice.

Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard.

Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
