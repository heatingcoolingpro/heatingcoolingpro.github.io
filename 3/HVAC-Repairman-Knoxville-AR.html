<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
