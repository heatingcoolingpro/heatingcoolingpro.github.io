<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
