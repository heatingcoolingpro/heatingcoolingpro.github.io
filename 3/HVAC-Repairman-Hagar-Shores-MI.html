<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
