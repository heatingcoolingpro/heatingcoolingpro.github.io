<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
