<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, cigarette smoking, home products, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured items.

<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
