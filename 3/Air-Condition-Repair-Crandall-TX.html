<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Crandall TX</h3>

These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions require.

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
