<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
