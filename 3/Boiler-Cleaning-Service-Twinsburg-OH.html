<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
