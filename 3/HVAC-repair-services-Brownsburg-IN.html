<h3>Best Heat Pump in Brownsburg IN</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
