<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Lees Summit MO - The Benefits</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using smart technology. Martin said the company can develop a control panel within the building's controls that will provide data on its systems to enable actual time exposure, providing the capability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial client, not just during new building and construction.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
