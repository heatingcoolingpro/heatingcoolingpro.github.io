<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Atkinson NC</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
