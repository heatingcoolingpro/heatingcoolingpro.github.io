<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps need to likewise be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures need to not be carried out until these problems have been fixed.<p>

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may see undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
