<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
