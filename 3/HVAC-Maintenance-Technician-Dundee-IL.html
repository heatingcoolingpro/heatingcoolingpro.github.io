This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room a/c provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
