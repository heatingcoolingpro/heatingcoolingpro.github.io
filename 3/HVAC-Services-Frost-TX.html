After two years, things began to alter. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
