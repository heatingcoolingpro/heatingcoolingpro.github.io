<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Westmont</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations construct up inside your home.<p>
