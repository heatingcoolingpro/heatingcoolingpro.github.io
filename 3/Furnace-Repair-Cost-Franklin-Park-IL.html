<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Franklin Park IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
