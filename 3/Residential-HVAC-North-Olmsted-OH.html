<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a new building.

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is important iin making sure the efficiency and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in tons. Usually, a 3-ton setup must be enough for the average home, but house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all elements which will affect the appropriate size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>
