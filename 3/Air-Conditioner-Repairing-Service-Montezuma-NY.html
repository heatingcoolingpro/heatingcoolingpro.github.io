<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.
