<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were useful and useful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and located methods we could have more even heat. He included these substantial but minor modifications in his bid. Since of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Similar to many home improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the home.

A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
