<p>Heating systems resemble vehicles. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Saint Leo FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
