<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no contaminant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might also be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a home with numerous windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. House owners would be well advised to perform a home energy audit to examine where improvements may be made to increase the effectiveness of an existing HVAC system. These modifications might in fact add up and possibly minimize your viewed need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "routine" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a particular standard. Occupational exposure limitations noted in health and safety policies and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to prevent disease or particular results (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial situations. These limits might not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
