<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Bloomingdale NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<h3>Air Condition System in Bloomingdale NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
