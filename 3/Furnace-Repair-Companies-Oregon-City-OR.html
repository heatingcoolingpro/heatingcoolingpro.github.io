<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

He plainly and completely discussed all issues and fixes in a way that made me confident in his ability to resolve my repair issues.

He likewise responded to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to an issue that could not be fixed on the first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and capability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
