<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many people.<p>
