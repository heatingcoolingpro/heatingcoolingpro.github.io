<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and home products like air fresheners, release contaminants basically continually. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the home, release pollutants intermittently. These consist of cigarette smoking, using malfunction-ing or unvented ranges, heaters, or space heaters, making use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, using paint strippers in remodeling activities, and using cleaning products and pesticides in housekeeping. High pollutant concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
