<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source far from occupants or even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your company ought to inspect measurements of air, temperature and humidity circulation. In addition, evaluation and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for developing usage and occupancy) ought to be performed. A structure walk-through to check for odors and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be helpful. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can become contaminated with bacteria or fungi and need to be eliminated, likewise.
