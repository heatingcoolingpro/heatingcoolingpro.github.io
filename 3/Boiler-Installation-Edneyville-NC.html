<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
