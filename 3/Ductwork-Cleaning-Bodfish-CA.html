<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, throughout new building and construction (homes usually use in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
