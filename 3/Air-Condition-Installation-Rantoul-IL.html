<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated problems-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics listed below might be proper.<p>
