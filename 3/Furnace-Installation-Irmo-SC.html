<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically found in indoor air are accountable for lots of hazardous impacts, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular health problems.

This can lead to the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
