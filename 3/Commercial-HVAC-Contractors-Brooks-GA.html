<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects pointed out. However, it is not always true that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
