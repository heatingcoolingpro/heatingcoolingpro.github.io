<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Overall, they tend to need less energy than other type of heating, and they're reasonably comfortable, not striking you with an unexpected rise of heat. They tend to cost about $6,000 to set up in the typical house. Since lots of air-source heat pumps have difficulty operating in exceptionally cold temperature levels, they're finest matched for temperate climates, and will generally require an alternate backup heating system.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
