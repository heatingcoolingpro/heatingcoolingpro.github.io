<p>PE firms tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
