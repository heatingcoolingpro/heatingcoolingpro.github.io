<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Blue Springs MO</h3>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as a vehicle radiator or common household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
