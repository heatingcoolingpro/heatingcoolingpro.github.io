<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
