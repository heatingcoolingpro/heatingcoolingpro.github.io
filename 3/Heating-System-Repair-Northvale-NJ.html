<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a harsh, harsh summer.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
