<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
