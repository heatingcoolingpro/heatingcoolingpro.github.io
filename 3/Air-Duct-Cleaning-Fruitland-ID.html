They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>

Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes.
