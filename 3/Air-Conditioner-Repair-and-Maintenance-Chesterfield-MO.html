<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production.

Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity pertained to buy what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
