Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
