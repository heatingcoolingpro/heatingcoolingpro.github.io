<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Pinopolis SC</h3>
<p>Since things ran smoothly without any noise, I was very pleased in the beginning. Furthermore, I saw noticeable modifications in my electrical power expenses. After 2 years, things began to change. There have been awkward sounds. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is completion of the concern. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
