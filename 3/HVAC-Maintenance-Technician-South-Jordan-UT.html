<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
