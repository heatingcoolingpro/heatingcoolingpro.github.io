<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Climate Pro is reputable and truly cared about us and our circumstance. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right prior to a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my buddies.<p>

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
