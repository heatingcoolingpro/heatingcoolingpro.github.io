The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has conducted.

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
