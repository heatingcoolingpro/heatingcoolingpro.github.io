The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
