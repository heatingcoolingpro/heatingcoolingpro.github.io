<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
