<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand.

Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
