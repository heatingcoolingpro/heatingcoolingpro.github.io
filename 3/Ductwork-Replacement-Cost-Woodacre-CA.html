<p>Buildings are designed or planned to react actively to some of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to enhance their durability, appearance, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps dramatically modify structures in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their impact on structure residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may discover it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying communities, in order to acquire an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are many other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
