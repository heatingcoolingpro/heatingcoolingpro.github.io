<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness inside is connected with a greater occurrence of occupant breathing issues.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
