<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
