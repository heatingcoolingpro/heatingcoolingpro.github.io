<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
