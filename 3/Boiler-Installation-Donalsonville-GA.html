<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
