<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
