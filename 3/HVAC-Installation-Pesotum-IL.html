This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
