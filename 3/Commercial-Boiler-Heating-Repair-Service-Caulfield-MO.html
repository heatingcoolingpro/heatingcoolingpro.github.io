<p>As with many house enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ commonly based on the size of the house. Most heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years.

A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
