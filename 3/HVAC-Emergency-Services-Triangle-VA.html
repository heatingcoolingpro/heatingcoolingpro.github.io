<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
