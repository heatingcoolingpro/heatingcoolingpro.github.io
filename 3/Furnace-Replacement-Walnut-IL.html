For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to cracks and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.. a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
