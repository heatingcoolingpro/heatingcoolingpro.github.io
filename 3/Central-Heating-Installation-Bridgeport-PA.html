<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at sensible energy costs.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract..
