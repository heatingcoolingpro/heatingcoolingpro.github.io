They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My spouse said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a very long time.
