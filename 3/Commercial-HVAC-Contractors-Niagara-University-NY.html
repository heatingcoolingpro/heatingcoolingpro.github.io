<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold notifies. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to deal with the scenario right away.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
