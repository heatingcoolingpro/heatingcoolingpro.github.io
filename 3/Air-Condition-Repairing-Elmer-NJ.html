<p>Home heating unit are made complex systems that need the services of a contractor to install. While you can certainly buy your furnace yourself, the majority of contractors won't service warranty the furnace or might not install it if you don't buy it from them.

<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in numerous countless asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
