<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
