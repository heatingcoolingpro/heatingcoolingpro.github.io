I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
