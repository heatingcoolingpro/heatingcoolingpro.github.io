<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
