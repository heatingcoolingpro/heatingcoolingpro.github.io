<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not require you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services ought to still be offered for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers normally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Ac system manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioner fails, begin by inspecting any fuses or breaker. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
