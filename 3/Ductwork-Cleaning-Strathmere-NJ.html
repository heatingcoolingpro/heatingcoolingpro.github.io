<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
