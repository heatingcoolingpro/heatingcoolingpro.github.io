<p>Central air units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are usually not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not achieve a performance greater than 90%.
