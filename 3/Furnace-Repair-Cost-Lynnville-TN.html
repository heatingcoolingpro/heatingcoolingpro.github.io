<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
