Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
