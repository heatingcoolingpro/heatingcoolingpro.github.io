For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
