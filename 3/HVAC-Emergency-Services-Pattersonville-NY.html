<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses suddenly seem higher than normal, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to discuss the money you'll save money on repair costs. You can probably expect to cut your fuel costs in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>
