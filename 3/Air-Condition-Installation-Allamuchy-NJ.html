<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Allamuchy NJ</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
