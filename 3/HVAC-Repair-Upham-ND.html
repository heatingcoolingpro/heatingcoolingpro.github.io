<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>

Excess moisture can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, unequal temperature policy, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
