These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully.

The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
