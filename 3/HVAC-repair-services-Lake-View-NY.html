Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation organisation entirely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Lake View NY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more common as readily available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been prevalent, as consumers stay mainly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
