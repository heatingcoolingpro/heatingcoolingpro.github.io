<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Turn off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).
