<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
