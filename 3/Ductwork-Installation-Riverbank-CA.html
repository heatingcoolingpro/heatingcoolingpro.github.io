Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
