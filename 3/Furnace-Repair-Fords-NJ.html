<p>Because they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
