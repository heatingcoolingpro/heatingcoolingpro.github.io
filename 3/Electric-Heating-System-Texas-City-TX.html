Service technicians are typically required to work in cramped locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofings of homes.

They consist of delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
