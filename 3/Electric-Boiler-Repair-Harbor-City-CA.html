<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved concerns. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.
