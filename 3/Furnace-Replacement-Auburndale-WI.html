<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
