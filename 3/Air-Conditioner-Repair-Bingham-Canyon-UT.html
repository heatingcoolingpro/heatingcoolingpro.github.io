<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioner is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician ought to repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant.

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
