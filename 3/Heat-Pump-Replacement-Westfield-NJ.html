<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be successfully identified or treated without a comprehensive structure examination. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives assess the history of resident symptoms and building operation procedures.
