This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly.
