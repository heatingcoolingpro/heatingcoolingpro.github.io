<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the inspection on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new property owner I have learned how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
