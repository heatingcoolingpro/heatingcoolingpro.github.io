When inspecting your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, constantly make sure.

An unexpected discharge from an a/c capacitor can cause extreme injury or death.<p>

Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
