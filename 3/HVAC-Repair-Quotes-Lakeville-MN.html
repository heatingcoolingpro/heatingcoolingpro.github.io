<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
