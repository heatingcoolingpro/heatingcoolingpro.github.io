<p>Many people underestimate the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is typically imagined as the black smoke discharged from factories. Little idea is provided to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints utilized in the house. To compound the issue, it is approximated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside, and over half that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
