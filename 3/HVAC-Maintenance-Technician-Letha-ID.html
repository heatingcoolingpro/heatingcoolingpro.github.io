<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
