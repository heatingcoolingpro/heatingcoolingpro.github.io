<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
