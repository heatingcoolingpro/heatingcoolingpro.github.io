<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's directions.<p>
