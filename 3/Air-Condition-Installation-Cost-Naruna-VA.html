<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
