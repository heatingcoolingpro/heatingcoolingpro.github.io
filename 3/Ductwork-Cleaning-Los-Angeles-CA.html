<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
