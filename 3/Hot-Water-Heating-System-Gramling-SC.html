<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works however your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
