<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore Whigham GA</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
