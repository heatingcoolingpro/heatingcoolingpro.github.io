<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not have the ability to cool the house correctly. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Replacing your old furnace with a new, more efficient design can fight unstable energy prices, lowering your heating expenses by as much as 45%. Improvements in heating technology have caused systems that pollute less, improve comfort, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace normally has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest efficiency enabled by law for brand-new gas models is 78%, and there are many options that accomplish 98%, for near overall effectiveness.<p>
