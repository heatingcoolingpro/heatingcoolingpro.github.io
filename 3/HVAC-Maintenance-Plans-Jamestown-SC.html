<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
