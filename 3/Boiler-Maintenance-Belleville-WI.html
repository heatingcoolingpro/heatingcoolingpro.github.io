<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. There are a number of design approaches in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.
