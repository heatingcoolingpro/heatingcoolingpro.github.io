<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
