<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most typical kind of home heating unit in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly alternative, however newer systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective natural gas furnaces can attain AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development doesn't always equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The heating, air and ventilation conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. Demand warms up during the summer and winter when customers require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather arrives.<p>
