<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Union Mills IN</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were handy and informative, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but considerable changes in his bid. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors.<p>
