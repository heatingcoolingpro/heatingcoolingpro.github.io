<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
