<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of most structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Outside impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.
