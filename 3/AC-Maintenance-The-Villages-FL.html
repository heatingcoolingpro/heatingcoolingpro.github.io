<p>They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for.

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
