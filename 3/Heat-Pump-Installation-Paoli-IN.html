Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
