<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
