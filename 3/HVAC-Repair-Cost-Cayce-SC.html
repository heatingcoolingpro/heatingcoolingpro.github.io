<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will worsen. Inspecting and altering the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
