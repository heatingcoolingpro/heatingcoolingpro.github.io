<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden seem greater than regular, it is most likely time to consider a new system. New heating devices is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs right now, not to point out the money you'll minimize repair costs. If your heating system is 25 years of ages or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
