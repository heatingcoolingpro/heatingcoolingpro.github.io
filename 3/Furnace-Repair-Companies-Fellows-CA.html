<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
