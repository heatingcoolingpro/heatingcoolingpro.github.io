<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
