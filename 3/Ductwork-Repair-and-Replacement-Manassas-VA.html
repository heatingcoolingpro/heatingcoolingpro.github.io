<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
