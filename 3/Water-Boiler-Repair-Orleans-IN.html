<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the harmful effects of lead.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
