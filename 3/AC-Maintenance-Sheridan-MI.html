The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
