<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
