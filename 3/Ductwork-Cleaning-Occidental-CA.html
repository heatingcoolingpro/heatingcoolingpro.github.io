<p>Energy performance can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to maintaining a correct temperature.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
