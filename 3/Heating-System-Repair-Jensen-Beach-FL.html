<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Jensen Beach FL</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
