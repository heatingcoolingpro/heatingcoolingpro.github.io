<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a very typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Cherry Hill NJ</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
