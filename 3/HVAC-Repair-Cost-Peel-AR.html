<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
