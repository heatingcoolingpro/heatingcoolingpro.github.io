<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your home will not be heated effectively and the system will have to continuously run to try to heat the entire house, which will increase heating bills.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that ideal temperature throughout the year.

Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
