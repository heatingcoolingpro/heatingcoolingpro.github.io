<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
