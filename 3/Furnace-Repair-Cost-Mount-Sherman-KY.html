<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not toxic, however might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria might also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire office or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
