<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not need to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory.
