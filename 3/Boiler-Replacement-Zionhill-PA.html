<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
