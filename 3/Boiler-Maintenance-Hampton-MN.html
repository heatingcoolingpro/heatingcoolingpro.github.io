Breathing air pollutants can lead to asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other health issue that include the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
