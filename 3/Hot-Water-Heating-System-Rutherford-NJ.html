<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c unit won't have the ability to cool your house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you need to consider when purchasing a new AC system. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people exhale co2, which in small quantities is not poisonous, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
