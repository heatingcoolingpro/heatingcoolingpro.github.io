<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
