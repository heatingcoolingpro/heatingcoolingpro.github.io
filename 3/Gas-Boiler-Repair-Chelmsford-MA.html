<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Chelmsford MA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
