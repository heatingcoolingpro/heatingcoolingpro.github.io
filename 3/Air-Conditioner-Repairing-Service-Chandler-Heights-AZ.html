Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
