<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
