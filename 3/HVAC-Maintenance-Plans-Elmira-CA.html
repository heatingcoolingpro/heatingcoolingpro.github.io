<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Elmira CA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
