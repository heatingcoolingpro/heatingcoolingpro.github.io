<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can imply substantial savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Due to the fact that they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
