<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
