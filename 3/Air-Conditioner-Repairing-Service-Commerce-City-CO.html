<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
