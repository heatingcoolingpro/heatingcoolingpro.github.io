<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
