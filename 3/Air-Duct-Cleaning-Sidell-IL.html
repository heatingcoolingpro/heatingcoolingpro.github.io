<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in explaining what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered great customer support at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater.

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
