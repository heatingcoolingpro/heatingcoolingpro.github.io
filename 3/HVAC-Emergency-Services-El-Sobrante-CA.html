Since they just partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon going into the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unsure.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides additional details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>

Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>

Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions.
