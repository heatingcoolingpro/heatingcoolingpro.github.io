<p>Current Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
