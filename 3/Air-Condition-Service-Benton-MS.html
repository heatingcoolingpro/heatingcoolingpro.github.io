Location the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every three months. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
