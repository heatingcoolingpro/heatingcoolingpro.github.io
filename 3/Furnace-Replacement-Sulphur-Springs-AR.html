<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
