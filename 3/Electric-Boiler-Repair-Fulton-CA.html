<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off.

Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
