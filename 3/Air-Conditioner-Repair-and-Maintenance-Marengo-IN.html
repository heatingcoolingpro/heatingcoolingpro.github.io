<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
