<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries.
