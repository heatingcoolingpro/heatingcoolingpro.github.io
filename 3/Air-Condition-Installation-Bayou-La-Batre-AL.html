<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and informative, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but considerable modifications in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>

<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
