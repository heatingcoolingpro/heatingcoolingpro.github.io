<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Hampton GA</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run constantly is because something is clogged up or dirty Prior to trying to fix any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Inspect the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it if the air filter is great to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
