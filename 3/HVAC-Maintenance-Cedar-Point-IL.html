<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
