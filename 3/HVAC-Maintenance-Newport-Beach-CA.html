<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Newport Beach CA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins produced by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
