His time and knowledge to RESOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Cazadero CA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
