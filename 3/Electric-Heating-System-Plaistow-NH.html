Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to likewise be checked regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire threat.
