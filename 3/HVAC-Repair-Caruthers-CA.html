When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
