<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
