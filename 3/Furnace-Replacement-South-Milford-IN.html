As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
