<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust.

For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
