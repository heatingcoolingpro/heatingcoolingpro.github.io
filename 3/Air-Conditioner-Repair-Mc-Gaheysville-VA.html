<h3>HVAC Maintenance Plans in Mc Gaheysville VA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
