<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
