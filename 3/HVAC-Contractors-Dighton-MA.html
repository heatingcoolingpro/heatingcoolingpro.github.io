<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
