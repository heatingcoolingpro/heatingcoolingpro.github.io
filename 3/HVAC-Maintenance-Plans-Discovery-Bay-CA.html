<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
