<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Duke MO HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>In-floor heater can come with specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this concern because they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Moreover, considering that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and signs up to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can decrease the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
