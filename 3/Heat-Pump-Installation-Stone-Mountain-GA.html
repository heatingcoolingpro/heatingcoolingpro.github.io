<p>These principles-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- might already be changing. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new real estate units have actually been built in the four years since or are currently under construction. The huge bulk of these systems are mixed-use or multi-family, where a/c is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Exposure Assessment Approach (GROUP) studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical natural toxins to be 2 to 5 times higher inside houses than outside, regardless of whether the houses were located in rural or extremely commercial areas. Additional TEAM studies suggest that while individuals are using items consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
