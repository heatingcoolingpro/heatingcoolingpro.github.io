<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
