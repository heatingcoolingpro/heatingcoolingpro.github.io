<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
