<p>There are lots of reasons this can take place. Fortunately is that you can attend to a lot of these elements by yourself without the requirement to call for professional assistance. Start by opening the heat signs up and then carry on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can also examine the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
