<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (homes normally use between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load.
