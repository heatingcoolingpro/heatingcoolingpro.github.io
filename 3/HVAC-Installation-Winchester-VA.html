<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Winchester VA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
