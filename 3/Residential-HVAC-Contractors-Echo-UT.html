<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air problems as single-family houses because a lot of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure materials, furnishings, and family items, are comparable.

<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heater. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.
