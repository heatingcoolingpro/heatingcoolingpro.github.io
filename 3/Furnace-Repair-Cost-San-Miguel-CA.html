<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
