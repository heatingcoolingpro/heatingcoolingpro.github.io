<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up.

A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are usually smaller sized than stick-built homes and use significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Anticipate the typical mobile house oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Remember that not as many brands produce oil heating systems for this usage, and you might find more options with natural gas, propane, or electric heaters.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
