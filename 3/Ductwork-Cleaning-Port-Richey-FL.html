Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
