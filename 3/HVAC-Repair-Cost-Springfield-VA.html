<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
