<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air might likewise be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the variety of workers in the location.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a home with numerous windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors rather than the air might not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. Homeowners would be well advised to carry out a house energy audit to evaluate where improvements may be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These changes could actually add up and potentially decrease your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Outside impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

For this factor, it is very important to pay attention to the time and place symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the location, for example, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
