<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up.

A dirty filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
