This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the house.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode".

This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
