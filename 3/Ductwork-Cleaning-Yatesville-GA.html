<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon celebrations.<p>
