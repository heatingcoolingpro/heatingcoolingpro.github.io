<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have.
