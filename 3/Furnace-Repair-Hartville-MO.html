<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and straightforward method to reduce ambient air contamination and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, particularly if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and replaced routinely. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will get worse. Checking and changing the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
