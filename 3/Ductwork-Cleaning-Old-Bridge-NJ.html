<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request.

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
