<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working.
