<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Sunset Beach NC</h3>

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
