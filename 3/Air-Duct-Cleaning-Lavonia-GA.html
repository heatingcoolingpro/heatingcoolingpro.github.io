First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy.
