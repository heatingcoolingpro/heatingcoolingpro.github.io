Such information can often be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
