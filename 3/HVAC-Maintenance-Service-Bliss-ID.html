<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, unstable organic compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtering and the use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the primary techniques for enhancing indoor air quality in most buildings. Residential systems can even more improve indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heat pump if temperature levels drop and reach below freezing.
