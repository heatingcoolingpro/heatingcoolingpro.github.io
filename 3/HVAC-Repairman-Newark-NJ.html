Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
