<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
