<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
