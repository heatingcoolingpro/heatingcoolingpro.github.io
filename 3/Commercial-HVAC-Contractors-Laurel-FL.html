<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most affordable if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
