<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

It has also been revealed to cause cancer in animals and might cause cancer in people.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
