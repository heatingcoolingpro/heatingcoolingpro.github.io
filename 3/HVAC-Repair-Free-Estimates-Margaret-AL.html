<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Margaret AL</h3>
<p>Ductless air conditioning is, obviously, ideal for homes without ducts, but is likewise a flexible solution for a variety of other circumstances. Rather of pressing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and flooring, ductless systems circulate air straight to particular rooms. Very cost-effective, and energy-efficient, and offering higher control over when and where the air goes in your house, All Points Heating can assist you choose the very best ductless cooling system for your requirements.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
