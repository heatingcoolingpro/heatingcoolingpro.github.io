<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
