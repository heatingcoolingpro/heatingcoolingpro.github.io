<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the very same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Consider purchasing an energy-efficient model if your air conditioner is old. Try to find the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems have to do with 15% more effective than standard designs. New residential central air conditioner standards went into impact on January 1, 2015; see the performance requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for details, and think about purchasing a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>
