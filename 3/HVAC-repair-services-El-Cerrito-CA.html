<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
