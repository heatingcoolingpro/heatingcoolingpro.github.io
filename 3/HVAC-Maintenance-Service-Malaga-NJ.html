Contact your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client problems have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate. Compare the numerous furnace efficiency scores suggested by the specific contractors to select the model and system that best suits your energy needs. Remember that energy-star rated devices will save you money in the end however might include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
