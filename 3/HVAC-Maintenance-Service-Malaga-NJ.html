Contact your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client problems have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate.

Remember that energy-star rated devices will save you money in the end however might include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
