<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home.
