<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Reeds Spring MO</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
