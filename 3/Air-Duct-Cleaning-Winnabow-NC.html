<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system.

Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>These two kinds of radiant flooring heat are basic in concept. However, both systems have a huge selection of various elements for various applications as well as a range of brand name and specific installation requirements. One of the greatest factors to consider in choosing a particular type of radiant floor heat is whether the application is in new construction or if it's being installed in a restoration.<p>
