<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture indoors is connected with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Similar to many home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ widely based on the size of the house. A lot of furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years.

A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
