<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Magnolia NC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
