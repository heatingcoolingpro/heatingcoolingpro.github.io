<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms related to exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels including health threat information and warns on the proper use of these products. Use products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; usage inside your home only if the area is well aerated.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building residents might be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning company tends to run cold and hot. Need heats up during the summer season and winter season when clients need their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather shows up.<p>
