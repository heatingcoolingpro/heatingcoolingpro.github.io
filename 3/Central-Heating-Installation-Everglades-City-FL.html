<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
