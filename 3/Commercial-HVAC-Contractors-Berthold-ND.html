<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Berthold ND</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
