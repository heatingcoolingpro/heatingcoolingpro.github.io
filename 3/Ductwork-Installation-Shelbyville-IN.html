A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
