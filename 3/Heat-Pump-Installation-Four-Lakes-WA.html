<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the recommended connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
