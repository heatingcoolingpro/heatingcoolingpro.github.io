<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>

It's a framework to revamp or guide the launch of your organisation that you can build upon and restructure as business develops.<p>
