<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outside system.

However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
