<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Fountain</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
