<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
