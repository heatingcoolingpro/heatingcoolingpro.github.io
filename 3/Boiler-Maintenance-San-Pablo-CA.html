<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for financial freedom.
