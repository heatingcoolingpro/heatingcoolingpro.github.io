They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Meadville MS?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Initially, know that a majority of your central air and system cost will originate from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can in fact go beyond $10,000 for larger homes. As you saw just recently, you require an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down earlier than expected or your regular monthly energy costs will skyrocket. Therefore, you do not have total control as to your AC unit product expenses.<p>
