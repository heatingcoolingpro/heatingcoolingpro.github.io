<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Plymouth Meeting</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
