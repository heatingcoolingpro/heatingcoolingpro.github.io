<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs.
