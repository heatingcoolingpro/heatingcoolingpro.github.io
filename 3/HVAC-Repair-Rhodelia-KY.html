Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
