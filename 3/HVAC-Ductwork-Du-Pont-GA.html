<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Du Pont GA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various house performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
