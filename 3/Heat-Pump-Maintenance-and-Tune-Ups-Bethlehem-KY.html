<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Service in Bethlehem</h2>

<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, offices and schools matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives inside. A/c help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid environments or in cases where the ac system is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your house.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
