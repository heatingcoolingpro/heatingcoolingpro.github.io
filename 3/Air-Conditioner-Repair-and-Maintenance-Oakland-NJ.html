<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

If you change a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, think about anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin because they have the very best heat exchanger guarantees in the industry on their top heating systems.<p>
