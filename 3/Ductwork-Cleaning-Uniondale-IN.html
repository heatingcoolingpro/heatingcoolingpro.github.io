<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to utilizing a radiant heating system over a conventional forced air heating unit. Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heaters, for something. Forced air heating unit tend to struggle with things like duct leaks, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output. Forced air heating unit likewise tend to create cold and hot spots throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>
