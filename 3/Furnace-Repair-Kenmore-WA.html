<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Kenmore WA</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home.
