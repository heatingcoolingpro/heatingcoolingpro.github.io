<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Lane SC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
