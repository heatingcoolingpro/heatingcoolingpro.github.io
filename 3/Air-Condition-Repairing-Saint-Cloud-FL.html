<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Sometimes it's not a significant problem, and your system might just need some maintenance work. It is surprising how many of us practice preventive maintenance on our vehicles, for instance, but don't do the very same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance.

By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
