<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
