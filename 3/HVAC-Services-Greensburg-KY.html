<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals, vehicles such as cars, trains, submarines, ships and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
