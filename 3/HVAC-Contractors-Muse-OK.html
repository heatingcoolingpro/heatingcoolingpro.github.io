The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>

If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the air conditioning system. A voided service warranty won't do you any great ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the start and employ a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
