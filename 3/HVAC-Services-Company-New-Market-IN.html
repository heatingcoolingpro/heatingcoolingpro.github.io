<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed.

But the chances are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside.

<h3>AC Technician in New Market IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

If the source of musty smells can be discovered and removed, it will improve the indoor air quality.<p>

When they state they will and the prices is competitive, their techs get here. They put in the time to explain the repairs and make ideas on how you can make your system more energy and cost efficient. If you need HVAC work, give them a call, you will not be disappointed.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury product and more like a necessity.
