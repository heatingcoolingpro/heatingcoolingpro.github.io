During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
