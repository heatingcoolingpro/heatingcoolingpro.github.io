Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
