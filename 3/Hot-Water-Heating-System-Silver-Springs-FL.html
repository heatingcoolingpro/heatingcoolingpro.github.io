<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Silver Springs FL Home Owners</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter or summertime, having a working HVAC system is vital. At Lowe's, we have a range of heating and cooling systems-- from heaters and heatpump to window air conditioning system and portable a/c Plus, we offer cooling installation and heating installation by licensed professional independent installers. Not sure if HVAC installation remains in your budget plan? We're proud to provide a range of special funding alternatives. When you need it, our house services offerings make it easy to get what you require.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
