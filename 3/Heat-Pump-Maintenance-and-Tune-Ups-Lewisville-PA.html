<p>As one of the most important financial investments and pieces of equipment in your house, it pays to monitor simply how efficiently and successfully your warm air oil or natural gas furnace is running.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
