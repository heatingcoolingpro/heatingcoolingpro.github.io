<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
