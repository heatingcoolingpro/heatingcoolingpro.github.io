<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
