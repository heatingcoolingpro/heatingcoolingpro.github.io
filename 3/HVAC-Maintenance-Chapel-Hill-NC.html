<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
