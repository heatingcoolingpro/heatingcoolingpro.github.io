Everybody we talked to from starting to end were really professional, polite and the work was really efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
