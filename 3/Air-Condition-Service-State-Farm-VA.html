<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
