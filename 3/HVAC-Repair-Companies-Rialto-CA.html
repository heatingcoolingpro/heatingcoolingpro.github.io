<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
