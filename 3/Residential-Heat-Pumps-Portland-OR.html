<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
