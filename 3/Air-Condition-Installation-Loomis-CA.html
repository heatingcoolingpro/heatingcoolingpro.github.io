<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a car radiator or common family air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

Radiators can be locally located in one location like a bathroom flooring or be installed across the entire sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are often used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
