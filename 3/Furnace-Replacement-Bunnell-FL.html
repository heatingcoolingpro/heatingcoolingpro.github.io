Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up.

A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While room a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
