This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While room a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
