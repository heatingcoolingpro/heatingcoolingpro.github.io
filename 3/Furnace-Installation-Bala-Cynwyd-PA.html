<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
