The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty.
