<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
