<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
