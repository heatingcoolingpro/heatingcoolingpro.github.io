<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
