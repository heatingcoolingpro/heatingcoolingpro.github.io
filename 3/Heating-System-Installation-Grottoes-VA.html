<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Grottoes VA?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
