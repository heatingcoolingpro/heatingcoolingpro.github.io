<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
