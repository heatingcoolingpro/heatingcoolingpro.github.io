A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system. In the outdoor system of this a/c there is a more effective compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems located in the space.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
