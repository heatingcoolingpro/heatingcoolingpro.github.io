The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Ivanhoe NC HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
