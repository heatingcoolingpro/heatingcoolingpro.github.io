<h3>Repair and Care for Littleton CO Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need reasonably little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is essential to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank ought to be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water locations). The systems must be inspected at least twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
