<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
