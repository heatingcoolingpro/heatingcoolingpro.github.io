<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality items and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance cooling and heating items around the world. Our air conditioning professionals have an interest in providing you the best service possible. We will inform you if your air conditioning unit will cost just as much to repair as it will to purchase a new unit. We don't believe in running our clients around and giving them incorrect details. As a Seattle company owner, you need a high quality air conditioning unit to keep your customers and your workers comfortable and pleased. By listening to our professionals, we can ensure you that you will get the very best information offered.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
