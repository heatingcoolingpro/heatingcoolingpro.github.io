<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a few feet below ground.

<p>Homeowners may likewise presume that because a glowing flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their house's value.

That said, homebuyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
