It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
