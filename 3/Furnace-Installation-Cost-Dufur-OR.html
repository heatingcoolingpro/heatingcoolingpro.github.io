<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
