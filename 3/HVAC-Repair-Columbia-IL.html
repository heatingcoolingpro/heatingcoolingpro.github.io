<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not toxic, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Germs or micro-organisms may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread throughout the entire workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
