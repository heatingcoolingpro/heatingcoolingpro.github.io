Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>
