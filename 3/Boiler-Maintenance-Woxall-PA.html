<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
