<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
