By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
