<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any new heating system in a home, it is required to re lower the energy and assess load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not just reduce the cost of a new system and utility costs, but it will significantly improve the convenience of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Fundamental enhancements normally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend several competent house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
