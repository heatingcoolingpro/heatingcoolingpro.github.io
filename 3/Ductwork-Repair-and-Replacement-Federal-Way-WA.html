<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
