<p>Lots of people ignore the level of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is normally visualized as the black smoke produced from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners used in the home. To compound the issue, it is approximated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and more than half that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer should check measurements of humidity, air and temperature flow. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for constructing use and tenancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to look for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be practical. Leaks require to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with germs or fungi and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some circumstances, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building occupancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outside air that should be continually provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
