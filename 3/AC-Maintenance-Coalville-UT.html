<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
